## Rapid Development Principles

1. Speed Over Perfection

   - Launch fast, iterate often
   - Minimize up-front design
   - Accept controlled technical debt
   - Focus on core features

2. Efficient Communication

   - Async by default
   - Brief, focused meetings
   - Clear documentation
   - Direct feedback channels

3. Resource Optimization
   - Parallel development
   - Automated processes
   - Reduced dependencies
   - Minimal coordination

## Risk Management

### High Priority

- Core functionality issues
- Critical path delays
- Integration failures
- Performance bottlenecks

### Secondary Priority

- Non-critical bugs
- Documentation gaps
- Minor UI issues
- Technical debt

## Progress Metrics

### Development Metrics

- Time to deployment
- Feature completion rate
- Critical bug count
- Integration frequency
- Feedback cycle time

### AI Operation Metrics

- Token usage efficiency
- AI response quality rate
- Agent coordination score
- Cost per feature
- Prompt success rate
- AI error frequency
- Response latency
- Model performance ratio

## AI Management Principles

1. Efficient Token Usage

   - Optimize prompt design
   - Batch similar requests
   - Cache frequent responses
   - Monitor usage patterns

2. Quality Control

   - Validate AI outputs
   - Implement verification chains
   - Monitor accuracy metrics
   - Track false positives/negatives

3. Cost Optimization

   - Use appropriate model tiers
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Batch operations
   - Monitor API usage

4. Performance Management
   - Load balance across agents
   - Implement retry strategies
   - Monitor response times
   - Optimize request patterns

## Daily Workflow

1. Priority Assessment

   - Review blockers
   - Update critical path
   - Adjust resources
   - Escalate risks

2. Team Alignment

   - Quick sync
   - Unblock issues
   - Share progress
   - Update goals

3. Delivery Focus
   - Monitor deployments
   - Validate features
   - Gather feedback
   - Plan iterations

## Project Phases

### 1. Initialization (1-2 days)

- Setup development environment
- Define MVP scope
- Create basic architecture
- Establish CI/CD

### 2. Rapid Development (1-2 weeks)

- Implement core features
- Continuous integration
- Basic testing
- Regular deployments

### 3. Iteration (Ongoing)

- User feedback
- Feature enhancement
- Performance optimization
- Scale infrastructure

## Success Criteria

- Working deployments
- Core features complete
- Basic reliability
- User acceptance
- Maintainable codebase

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. Over-planning
2. Perfect solutions
3. Excessive meetings
4. Detailed documentation
5. Complex processes

## Output Format
