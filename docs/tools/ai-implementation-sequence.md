## Detailed Implementation Sequence

### 1️⃣ Context Assessment
- Complete the Context Assessment Framework
- Ask clarifying questions if information is missing
- Explore existing code to understand patterns
- NEVER skip this step - implementation quality depends on proper context

### 2️⃣ State Documentation
- Record current project state using the Context Maintenance Structure
- Document component hierarchy
- Document state management approach
- Record integration points with existing code

### 3️⃣ Planning Phase
- Classify components using Component Rules
- Select state management approach using State Rules
- Create a step-by-step implementation plan
- Define interfaces and APIs
- Plan error handling and edge cases

### 4️⃣ Rule Validation
- Validate plan against ZenReact standards
- Ensure compliance with Component Rules
- Verify state management follows State Rules
- Check architecture alignment with Architecture Rules
- Confirm testing approach follows Testing Strategy

### 5️⃣ Implementation
- Follow the plan step-by-step
- Implement each component following templates
- Apply state management according to plan
- Add error handling and edge cases
- Implement tests following Test Template

### 6️⃣ Quality Validation
- Complete Implementation Checklists
- Verify adherence to coding standards
- Ensure proper documentation
- Validate tests cover all scenarios
- Check accessibility and performance

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Skipping or rushing through any of these steps will result in:
- Poor code quality
- Difficult-to-maintain components
- Inconsistent architecture
- Inefficient state management
- Potential bugs and regressions

## Recovery Process

If implementation has begun without proper planning:
1. STOP immediately
2. Return to Context Assessment
3. Document current progress
4. Create a plan for remaining work
5. Resume implementation following the plan

## Context Maintenance During Implementation

As you implement features, continuously update:
- Context Maintenance Structure
- Decision history
- Implementation progress
- Integration points

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before considering implementation complete, verify:
- [ ] Implementation follows the documented plan
- [ ] Code adheres to ZenReact standards
- [ ] All components follow appropriate templates
- [ ] State management follows State Rules
- [ ] Tests cover all relevant scenarios
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed

Remember: **Never sacrifice quality for speed. Plan first, implement second.**
