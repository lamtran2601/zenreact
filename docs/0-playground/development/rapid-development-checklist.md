# Rapid Development Checklist

## Core Philosophy

- Get it working first
- Iterate quickly
- Optimize later
- Keep it simple

## 1. Quick Start Process

    C --> D[Ship It]
    D --> E[Iterate/Improve]
```

## 2. Development Priorities

### First Priority: Working Solution

- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] Minimum viable tests
- [ ] Simple documentation

### Second Priority: Iteration

- [ ] Get user feedback
- [ ] Quick fixes
- [ ] Add essential features
- [ ] Basic refactoring

### Third Priority: Optimization

- [ ] Performance improvements
- [ ] Code cleanup
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive tests

## 3. Quick Implementation Guide

### Start Fast

- Use existing code/patterns when available
- Choose simple solutions over perfect ones
- Implement minimum requirements first
- Skip non-essential features

### Code Smart

- Minimal abstractions
- Direct solutions
- Simple patterns
- Basic error handling

### Test Essential

- Test core functionality only
- Skip edge cases initially
- Focus on happy path
- Manual testing for speed

## 4. Context Optimization

### Code First

- Basic structure
- Core functionality
- Essential imports
- Minimal comments

### Improve Later

- Add documentation
- Optimize imports
- Clean up code
- Add detailed comments

## 5. Quick Review Points

### Must Have

- [ ] Core functionality works
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] Can be tested
- [ ] No obvious bugs

### Nice to Have (Later)

- [ ] Detailed documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] Code cleanup

## 6. Rapid Response Workflow

1. Quick Analysis

   - Core requirements only
   - Simple solution path
   - Fast implementation plan

2. Fast Implementation

   - Basic structure
   - Core functionality
   - Essential tests
   - Simple docs

3. Quick Ship

   - Basic testing

   - User feedback

## Remember

1. Speed Over Perfection

   - Working beats perfect
   - Simple beats complex
   - Now beats later
   - Done beats perfect

2. Keep It Simple

   - Minimal code
   - Direct solutions
   - Basic patterns
   - Clear structure

3. Iterate Quick
   - Ship fast
   - Get feedback
   - Fix quick
   - Improve steady

## Quick Decision Matrix

### Do Now

- Core functionality
- Essential features
- Basic tests
- Simple docs

### Do Later

- Optimization
- Detailed docs
- Complete tests
- Refactoring

### Maybe Never

- Perfect patterns
- Complete optimization
- Edge cases
- Complex features

## Daily Speed Tips

1. Morning

   - Plan quick wins
   - Set core goals
   - Choose simple path

2. Development

   - Write simple code
   - Test basics only
   - Ship frequently

3. Evening
   - Quick review
   - Basic fixes
   - Plan next day

Remember: Speed now, polish later. Get the core working and iterate based on real feedback.
