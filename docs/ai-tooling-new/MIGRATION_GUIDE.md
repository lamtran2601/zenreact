## Current Structure vs. New Structure

| Current Structure | New Structure | Migration Action |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| AI_SYSTEM.md | SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md | Reorganize and enhance |
| context.md | core/AUTO_CONTEXT.md | Refocus on automation |
| rules-and-patterns.md | rules/* and patterns/* | Split and categorize |
| implementation.md | core/RULE_ENGINE.md | Refocus on validation |
| status.md | (Removed) | Content merged into relevant docs |
| learnings.md | (Removed) | Content merged into relevant docs |
| examples.md | patterns/EXAMPLES.md | Reorganize and enhance |
| patterns/* | patterns/COMMON_PATTERNS.md | Consolidate and standardize |
| examples/* | patterns/EXAMPLES.md | Consolidate and enhance |

## Phase 1: Core Simplification

### Document Reorganization

1. **Create New Structure**
   - Create the new directory structure
   - Set up placeholder files for all new documents
   - Establish cross-linking between documents

2. **Map Content**
   - Identify content in existing documents
   - Map content to new document structure
   - Identify overlapping or redundant content

3. **Migrate Core Content**
   - Move content to appropriate new documents
   - Update references and links
   - Ensure backward compatibility

### Content Consolidation

1. **Identify Redundancies**
   - Review all existing documents for redundant information
   - Mark sections for consolidation
   - Create consolidation plan

2. **Merge Content**
   - Combine related information from multiple sources
   - Eliminate duplications
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage

3. **Streamline Information**
   - Remove human-centric explanations
   - Focus on AI-relevant information
   - Ensure concise, actionable content

### Structure Simplification

1. **Establish Clear Hierarchy**
   - Define clear document hierarchy
   - Ensure logical organization
   - Create consistent navigation

2. **Standardize Format**
   - Apply consistent formatting across all documents
   - Use standard sections and headings
   - Implement consistent examples

3. **Optimize for AI**
   - Structure content for AI consumption
   - Use pattern-based organization
   - Include machine-readable formats

## Phase 2: Rule Enhancement

### Rule Definition

1. **Identify Core Rules**
   - Review existing rules and patterns
   - Identify fundamental rules
   - Categorize rules (Basic, Code, Doc)

2. **Define Rule Structure**
   - Create standard rule format
   - Include validation criteria
   - Add examples for each rule

3. **Document Rules**
   - Create comprehensive rule documentation
   - Include usage guidance
   - Provide implementation examples

### Validation System

1. **Design Validation Process**
   - Define how rules are validated
   - Establish validation criteria
   - Create validation workflow

2. **Implement Validation Logic**
   - Develop validation algorithms
   - Create rule checking mechanisms
   - Establish feedback system

3. **Test Validation System**
   - Validate against existing implementations
   - Refine validation logic
   - Ensure accurate rule checking

### Automation Implementation

1. **Automate Rule Application**
   - Implement automatic rule selection
   - Create context-aware rule application
   - Develop rule prioritization

2. **Automate Validation**
   - Implement automatic validation
   - Create real-time feedback
   - Develop correction suggestions

3. **Integrate with Core System**
   - Connect with Auto-Context system
   - Integrate with Quality System
   - Establish cross-component communication

## Phase 3: Pattern Focus

### Pattern Identification

1. **Identify Key Patterns**
   - Review existing implementations
   - Identify common patterns
   - Categorize patterns

2. **Define Pattern Structure**
   - Create standard pattern format
   - Include usage context
   - Add implementation guidance

3. **Document Patterns**
   - Create comprehensive pattern documentation
   - Include usage examples
   - Provide adaptation guidance

### Example Creation

1. **Develop Example Implementations**
   - Create examples for each pattern
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Include edge cases

2. **Document Examples**
   - Create clear example documentation
   - Include usage context
   - Provide customization guidance

3. **Test Examples**
   - Validate examples against rules
   - Ensure quality standards
   - Verify usability

### Template Development

1. **Create Reusable Templates**
   - Develop templates for common implementations
   - Ensure flexibility and adaptability
   - Include customization points

2. **Document Templates**
   - Create template documentation
   - Include usage guidance
   - Provide customization examples

3. **Test Templates**
   - Validate templates against rules
   - Ensure quality standards
   - Verify usability

## Backward Compatibility

To ensure backward compatibility during migration:

1. **Maintain Old Structure**
   - Keep old structure during transition
   - Update old documents to reference new structure
   - Gradually phase out old structure

2. **Create Redirects**
   - Add references in old documents to new locations
   - Create symbolic links where appropriate
   - Provide migration notices

3. **Update References**
   - Identify all references to old structure
   - Update references to point to new structure
   - Verify all links work correctly
