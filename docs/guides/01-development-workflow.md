# Development Workflow for Autonomous React Development

This guide outlines the recommended workflow for developing React applications with AI assistance in the ZenReact framework.

## Core Workflow Principles

1. **Context-First Development**: Always establish and maintain clear context
2. **Template-Based Components**: Use consistent patterns for predictability
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Build features in small, testable increments
4. **Continuous Validation**: Test and verify at each development step
5. **Clear Communication**: Express requirements with sufficient context

## The Autonomous Development Cycle

### 1. Planning Phase

**Activities:**
- Define feature requirements
- Break down into component hierarchy
- Identify state management needs
- Document expected behavior

**AI Collaboration Points:**
- Feature breakdown assistance
- Component structure suggestions
- Identification of reusable patterns
- State management approach planning

**Example Prompt:**
```
"I need to build a user dashboard feature with:
- A summary statistics section at the top
- A recent activity feed in the middle
- A settings panel on the right side

This should use our existing Layout components and fetch data using our API hooks pattern.
Let's plan the component structure and state management approach."
```

### 2. Component Skeleton Creation

**Activities:**
- Create component file structure
- Define component interfaces (props)
- Establish basic component relationships
- Create empty test files

**AI Collaboration Points:**
- Generating TypeScript interfaces
- Setting up component file structure
- Creating test skeletons
- Defining prop contracts

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Let's create the skeleton for our UserDashboard feature with TypeScript interfaces.
The main components will be:
- UserDashboard (container)
- StatsSummary
- ActivityFeed
- SettingsPanel

Follow our component template structure with proper typing for all props."
```

### 3. State Management Implementation

**Activities:**
- Create necessary state stores or context
- Define state structure and actions
- Connect components to state
- Implement data fetching logic

**AI Collaboration Points:**
- State structure implementation
- Custom hook creation
- API integration
- Data transformation logic

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Now let's implement the state management for our UserDashboard.
We need:
1. A custom hook called useUserDashboard that fetches user stats and activity
2. Local state for the settings panel
3. Connection to our existing UserContext for user details

Follow our state management patterns for API data fetching with loading/error states."
```

### 4. Component Implementation

**Activities:**
- Implement component rendering logic
- Add event handlers and interactions
- Style components according to design
- Implement conditional rendering

**AI Collaboration Points:**
- Component logic implementation
- Styled component creation
- Event handler implementation
- Conditional rendering logic

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Let's implement the StatsSummary component now. It should:
- Display 3-4 key metrics in our Card component
- Show loading states while data is being fetched
- Use our existing typography and color system
- Be responsive according to our breakpoint system
- Handle empty or error states appropriately"
```

### 5. Testing

**Activities:**
- Implement unit tests for components
- Test state management logic
- Verify component interactions
- Test edge cases and error handling

**AI Collaboration Points:**
- Test case generation
- Test implementation
- Edge case identification
- Mock creation

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Now let's write tests for the StatsSummary component:
1. Test initial loading state
2. Test successful data rendering
3. Test error state
4. Test empty data handling

Use our React Testing Library patterns and follow our test template structure."
```

### 6. Review and Refinement

**Activities:**
- Review component functionality
- Optimize performance
- Refine styling and interactions
- Address accessibility concerns

**AI Collaboration Points:**
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Accessibility improvements
- Code quality enhancements
- Refactoring recommendations

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Review our UserDashboard implementation for:
1. Performance optimization opportunities (unnecessary re-renders, etc.)
2. Accessibility issues (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, etc.)
3. Code quality improvements
4. Potential edge cases we haven't handled"
```

## Context Maintenance Throughout Development

### Context Refreshing

Regularly update AI on changes to project context:

```
"I've just updated our theme system to use CSS variables instead of styled-components theme.
Keep this in mind as we continue developing components."
```

### Context Switching

When moving between features, provide context transition:

```
"We're now switching from the UserDashboard feature to work on the Notifications feature.
The Notifications feature uses a WebSocket connection managed by our useNotifications hook."
```

### Expanding Context

Gradually expand AI's understanding of the codebase:

```
"For reference, here's our current component hierarchy for the authenticated user flow:
- AuthenticatedLayout
  - Header (with UserMenu)
  - Sidebar (with Navigation)
  - MainContent
    - [Various page components]
  - Footer"
```

## Best Practices for AI Collaboration

1. **Be Specific About Patterns**: "Follow our existing pattern for data fetching as shown in the ProductList component"

2. **Provide Example References**: "Structure this similar to how we implemented the UserCard component"

3. **Explain Constraints**: "We can't use Context API for this because we need to persist this state across page navigations"

4. **Highlight Priority Concerns**: "Focus particularly on performance optimization for this list component as it will render many items"

5. **Give Design Context**: "This should follow our spacing system with 'md' spacing between elements"

## Troubleshooting Common Workflow Issues

### Misaligned Understanding

**Issue**: AI has misunderstood project patterns or requirements.

**Solution**: Provide explicit examples from existing code:
```
"The component structure you suggested doesn't match our pattern. 
For reference, here's how we structure feature components:
[Example code from existing feature]"
```

### Context Fragmentation

**Issue**: Context has become fragmented across multiple conversations.

**Solution**: Provide consolidated context summary:
```
"Let me recap our current approach for this feature:
1. We're using local component state with useState
2. API data is fetched with our useFetch hook
3. We're following the Compound Component pattern
4. Styling uses styled-components with our theme"
```

### Pattern Drift

**Issue**: Inconsistent application of patterns across the codebase.

**Solution**: Create or reference documentation for the pattern:
```
"Let's make sure we're consistent with our form handling pattern.
Reference our FormTemplate document for the standard approach."
```

## Conclusion

The autonomous development workflow is iterative and relies heavily on clear communication of context. By following this workflow and maintaining rich context throughout the development process, teams can effectively leverage AI assistance to build React applications efficiently while maintaining consistency and quality.
