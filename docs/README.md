# ZenReact: Autonomous React Development

Welcome to ZenReact, a React application framework designed for optimal autonomous development with AI assistance. This documentation guides both developers and AI assistants on how to effectively collaborate on building React applications.

## Documentation Purpose

This guide helps establish clear patterns, workflows, and expectations for AI-assisted React development. By following these guidelines, developers can:

1. Maximize productivity with AI agents
2. Maintain consistent codebase architecture
3. Ensure best practices in React development
4. Create context-rich communication with AI assistants

## Applying ZenReact to Your ReactJS Project

### For New Projects
1. Start by reading the [Development Workflow](./guides/01-development-workflow.md) guide
2. Set up your project structure following the [Architecture Rules](./rules/architecture-rules.md)
3. Create your first components using the [Component Template](./templates/component-template.md)
4. Implement state management following the [State Management](./guides/04-state-management.md) guide
5. Set up testing using the [Testing Strategy](./guides/05-testing-strategy.md)

### For Existing Projects
1. Begin by reviewing the [Coding Standards](./rules/coding-standards.md) 
2. Gradually refactor components to follow the [Component Rules](./rules/component-rules.md)
3. Incrementally adapt your state management to align with [State Rules](./rules/state-rules.md)
4. Add tests according to the [Test Template](./templates/test-template.md)
5. Establish AI collaboration workflows using [Context Management](./guides/02-context-management.md)

## For AI Assistants

AI agents should:
1. Review the [AI Assistant Guide](./ai-assistant-guide.md) for comprehensive guidance
2. Maintain awareness of the project's component hierarchy and architecture
3. Follow the established patterns in the templates directory
4. Adhere to the rules in the rules directory
5. Ask clarifying questions when context is insufficient
6. Suggest improvements that align with project standards

## Contributing

This documentation evolves with the project. Propose changes that improve clarity, address gaps, or incorporate new best practices as they emerge.
