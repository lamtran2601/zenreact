## Backward Compatibility

To ensure backward compatibility during migration:

1. **Maintain Old Structure**

   - Keep old structure during transition
   - Update old documents to reference new structure
   - Gradually phase out old structure

2. **Create Redirects**

   - Add references in old documents to new locations
   - Create symbolic links where appropriate
   - Provide migration notices

3. **Update References**
   - Identify all references to old structure
   - Update references to point to new structure
   - Verify all links work correctly

## Conclusion

This migration guide provides a structured approach to transitioning from the previous AI Tooling system to the new rules-based architecture. By focusing on clear rules, patterns, and examples rather than complex implementations, the system becomes more maintainable and effective. The phased approach ensures a smooth transition while improving the system's usability and scalability through well-documented guidelines and practices.
