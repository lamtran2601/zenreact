    - User impact
    - Revenue potential
    - Strategic alignment
    - Market differentiation
    
  technical_value:
    - Technical debt reduction
    - Architecture improvement
    - Performance enhancement

  customization:
    - Adjust weights based on project phase
    - Increase urgency weight for critical deadlines
    - Emphasize technical value for refactoring phases
    - Focus on business value for feature development
```

      - Isolated impact
    response:
      - Scheduled as resources allow
      - Secondary resource allocation
      - Standard tracking
      - May be deferred if needed
      
  backlog:
    score: 0.0 - 2.9
    characteristics:
      - Minimal immediate value
      - No timeline constraints
      - No critical dependencies
      - Nice-to-have features
    response:
      - Kept in backlog
      - Periodically reassessed
      - Implemented when resources available

```

### Visual Indicators

```yaml
priority_indicators:
  symbols:
    critical: ðŸ”´
    high: ðŸŸ 
    medium: ðŸŸ¡
    low: ðŸŸ¢
    backlog: âšª
    
  labels:
    critical: "P0"
    high: "P1"
    medium: "P2"
    low: "P3"
    backlog: "P4"
```

## Decision Framework

### Prioritization Process

```yaml
prioritization_process:
  steps: 1. Gather task information
    2. Assess value dimensions
    3. Evaluate urgency factors
    4. Consider dependencies
    5. Calculate priority score
    6. Assign priority level
    7. Review and adjust
    
  frequency:
    - Initial backlog creation
    - Sprint planning
    - Major milestone completion
    - Significant requirement changes
```

### Decision Matrix

```yaml
decision_matrix:
  axes:
    x: Business Value (Low to High)
    y: Urgency (Low to High)
    
  quadrants:
    q1: # High Value, High Urgency
      label: "Do First"
      priority: Critical/High
      
    q2: # Low Value, High Urgency
      label: "Do Next"
      priority: High/Medium
      
    q3: # High Value, Low Urgency
      label: "Schedule"
      priority: Medium
      
    q4: # Low Value, Low Urgency
      label: "Backlog"
      priority: Low/Backlog
```

## Dependency Management

### Dependency Types

```yaml
dependency_types:
  blocking:
    description: Task cannot start until dependency is complete
    impact: Critical for sequencing
    visualization: Solid arrow
    
  partial:
    description: Task can start but cannot complete without dependency
    impact: Important for planning
    visualization: Dashed arrow
    
  related:
    description: Tasks are related but not strictly dependent
    impact: Efficiency opportunity
    visualization: Dotted line
```

### Dependency Analysis

```yaml
dependency_analysis:
  steps: 1. Identify all dependencies
    2. Classify dependency types
    3. Create dependency graph
    4. Identify critical paths
    5. Optimize task sequence
    
  visualization:
    - Dependency graphs
    - Critical path highlighting
    - Sequence diagrams
    - Gantt charts
```

## Resource Optimization

### Resource Allocation

```yaml
resource_allocation:
  principles:
    - Match skills to requirements
    - Balance workload
    - Consider learning curves
    - Maintain focus
    
  patterns:
    - Assign related tasks to same resources
    - Group similar technical tasks
    - Balance complex and simple tasks
    - Consider context switching costs
```

### Capacity Planning

```yaml
capacity_planning:
  calculation: |
    Available Capacity = Team Size Ã— Working Days Ã— Efficiency Factor
    
  considerations:
    - Skill distribution
    - Concurrent tasks
    - Support responsibilities
    - Non-development activities
    
  optimization:
    - Critical tasks first
    - Dependency resolution
    - Skill matching
    - Context minimization
```

## Best Practices

prioritization_best_practices:
  principles:
    - Be objective in assessment
    - Consider full context
    - Balance short and long-term
    - Reassess regularly
    - Communicate clearly
    
  pitfalls:
    - Recency bias
    - Squeaky wheel prioritization
    - Ignoring technical debt
    - Underestimating dependencies
    - Overcommitting resources
```

### Continuous Improvement

```yaml
improvement_process:
  steps: 1. Track priority effectiveness
    2. Analyze completion patterns
    3. Review value realization
    4. Adjust prioritization factors
    5. Refine decision process
    
  metrics:
