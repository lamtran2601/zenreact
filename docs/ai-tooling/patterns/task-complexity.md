## Complexity Factors

```yaml
complexity_factors:
  technical:
    - Implementation difficulty
    - Technical knowledge required
    - Algorithmic complexity
    - Performance considerations
    
  integration:
    - Number of dependencies
    - System coupling
    - Interface complexity
    - Cross-cutting concerns
    
  scope:
    - Feature breadth
    - Implementation depth
    - Edge cases
    - Configuration options
    
  quality:
    - Testing requirements
    - Documentation needs
    - Performance expectations
    - Security considerations
```

### Factor Weighting

```yaml
factor_weighting:
  calculation: |
    Weighted Complexity = Î£(Factor Weight Ã— Factor Score)
    
  default_weights:
    technical: 0.35
    integration: 0.25
    scope: 0.20
    quality: 0.20
    
  adjustment:
    - Project-specific priorities may adjust weights
    - Critical path items may receive higher weights
    - Novel technology areas may increase technical weight
```

## Assessment Framework

### Complexity Scoring

```yaml
complexity_scoring:
  scale:
    - 1: Trivial - Simple, well-understood, minimal dependencies
    - 2: Easy - Straightforward, few dependencies, clear requirements
    - 3: Moderate - Some complexity, multiple dependencies, standard patterns
    - 4: Complex - Significant complexity, many dependencies, advanced patterns
    - 5: Very Complex - Highly complex, extensive dependencies, novel solutions
    
  dimensions:
    - Technical difficulty (1-5)
    - Integration complexity (1-5)
    - Scope breadth (1-5)
    - Quality requirements (1-5)
```

### Assessment Process

```yaml
assessment_process:
  steps: 1. Identify all complexity factors
    2. Score each dimension
    3. Apply appropriate weights
    4. Calculate weighted score
    5. Determine complexity level
    
  validation:
    - Peer review of assessment
    - Historical comparison
    - Expert validation
    - Iterative refinement
```

  adjustment_factors:
    - Developer experience
    - Familiarity with domain
    - Available documentation
    - Similar previous work
    - Technical debt
```

### Effort Calculation

```yaml

    - Technical lead
    - Development team
    - Architecture review
    - Specialized testing
    - Stakeholder involvement
```

## Best Practices

### Assessment Guidelines

```yaml
assessment_guidelines:
  principles:

    - Assuming perfect knowledge
    - Neglecting risk factors
```

### Continuous Improvement

    3. Refine scoring criteria
    4. Update estimation factors
    5. Document learnings
    
  metrics:
    - Estimation accuracy
    - Complexity distribution
    - Resource allocation efficiency
    - Project predictability
