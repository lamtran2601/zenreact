# ZenReact: Optimized Autonomous Development Workflow

## 🚨 CRITICAL: MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE 🚨

For every development task, AI assistants **MUST** follow this sequence without exception:

1. **Context Assessment** → Complete a structured context analysis
2. **State Documentation** → Document the current project state
3. **Planning Phase** → Create a detailed implementation plan
4. **Rule Validation** → Verify the plan against ZenReact standards
5. **Implementation** → Follow the plan step-by-step 
6. **Quality Validation** → Complete implementation checklists

❌ **NEVER SKIP ANY PLANNING PHASES** - Implementation must never begin without proper context assessment and planning.

## Workflow Optimization Techniques

### 1. Context Optimization

#### Structured Context Template
```json
{
  "project_context": {
    "current_feature": "[Feature name]",
    "active_components": ["ComponentA", "ComponentB"],
    "related_files": ["path/to/component.tsx", "path/to/hook.ts"],
    "component_hierarchy": ["App > PageComponent > FeatureComponent"],
    "state_dependencies": ["useFeatureStore", "useDataQuery"]
  },
  "decision_history": [
    {"decision": "[Decision made]", "reason": "[Reasoning]", "rule_reference": "[Rule citation]"}
  ],
  "implementation_progress": {
    "completed": ["Component structure", "Props interface"],
    "in_progress": ["State management", "Event handlers"],
    "pending": ["Accessibility", "Testing", "Documentation"]
  }
}
```

#### Enhanced Context Gathering
- Use automated code exploration to map component hierarchies
- Generate and maintain relationship graphs for components and state
- Implement progressive context refinement throughout development
- Store context in project-specific knowledge base for continuity

### 2. Planning Acceleration

#### Step-Based Planning Matrix
For each implementation, create a matrix with these columns:
- **Implementation Step** - Specific action to take
- **Files Affected** - Files that will be created or modified
- **Dependencies** - Components, hooks, or utilities needed
- **ZenReact Rules** - Specific rules to follow
- **Testing Strategy** - How the implementation will be tested

#### Pre-Implementation Validation
Before starting implementation:
- Verify component classifications against Component Rules
- Confirm state management approach matches State Rules
- Check integration points for architectural consistency
- Validate testing approach against Testing Strategy

### 3. Implementation Efficiency

#### Parallel Development Patterns
- Implement UI components in parallel with data fetching logic
- Develop tests alongside component implementation
- Create documentation concurrently with code

#### Template-Driven Development
- Use standardized templates for all code creation
- Implement consistent file organization patterns
- Follow established naming conventions
- Apply uniform comment and documentation styles

### 4. Continuous Validation

#### Automated Rule Compliance
- Apply ZenReact rules automatically during implementation
- Reference specific rules in code comments for clarity
- Track rule application in decision history

#### Progressive Implementation Checklist
Complete these checklists incrementally during development:
```
□ Component Classification
  □ Correctly identified component type
  □ Applied appropriate patterns
  □ Component has single responsibility

□ Component Structure
  □ Used function declaration (not arrow function)
  □ Followed proper file organization
  □ Used proper naming conventions

  □ Included default values where appropriate
  □ Grouped related props logically

□ State Management
  □ Used appropriate state management approach
  □ Kept state as local as possible
  □ Implemented immutable state updates
  □ Properly memoized values and callbacks

□ Error Handling
  □ Handled loading, error, and empty states
  □ Implemented appropriate error boundaries
  □ Provided fallbacks for missing data
  □ Included retry mechanisms where appropriate

□ Performance

  □ Avoided unnecessary re-renders
  □ Used proper dependency arrays
  □ Implemented lazy loading if needed

□ Accessibility

  □ Added JSDoc comments
  □ Documented all props
  □ Included usage examples
  □ Noted any performance considerations
```

### 5. Adaptive Decision Making

#### Rule Application Decision Tree
```
Component Implementation
├── UI Component (no business logic)
│   ├── Apply UI Component Template
│   ├── Keep state minimal and local
│   └── Focus on presentation and accessibility
├── Layout Component (arrangement focus)
│   ├── Apply Layout Component Template
│   ├── Use CSS Grid or Flexbox appropriately
│   └── Focus on responsive behavior
├── Container Component (data/logic focus)
│   ├── Apply Container Component Template
│   ├── Implement data fetching and processing
│   └── Pass data to UI components
├── Page Component (route-level)
│   ├── Apply Page Component Template
│   ├── Organize container and layout components
│   └── Handle route-level state and effects
└── Compound Component (related components)
    ├── Apply Compound Component Template
    ├── Create coordinated component set
    └── Implement shared context if needed
```

#### State Management Selection Matrix
| State Type | Scope | Persistence | Recommendation |
|------------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| UI State | Component | Temporary | useState |
| UI State | Component Tree | Temporary | useContext + useState |
| Form State | Component | Temporary | React Hook Form |
| Server State | Application | Cached | React Query |
| Application State | Global | Session | Zustand |
| Application State | Global | Persistent | Zustand + localStorage |

### 6. Workflow Integration

#### Autonomous Implementation Loop
1. **Initial Context** - Gather initial project context
2. **Plan Creation** - Develop detailed implementation plan
3. **Validation** - Verify plan against ZenReact standards
4. **Implementation** - Execute plan with continuous validation
5. **Refinement** - Update context with implementation details
6. **Verification** - Complete implementation checklists

8. **Context Update** - Update project context for future tasks

#### Context Persistence Strategy
- Maintain context documentation in dedicated files
- Update context after each implementation phase
- Reference previous context in new implementations
- Store decision history with rationales
