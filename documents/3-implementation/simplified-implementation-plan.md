# Simplified Implementation Plan

## Core Philosophy

- Focus on basic functionality first
- Remove unnecessary complexity
- Get working implementation before optimization
- Keep core features, defer advanced features

## Immediate Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation

1. Simplify useOptimizedState

   - Basic state management with minimal comparison logic
   - Remove complex diffing/tracking initially
   - Focus on common use cases

2. Simplify withOptimization HOC

   - Basic component wrapping
   - Simple prop comparison
   - Remove advanced optimization strategies initially

3. Reduce Utils Complexity

   - Start with basic comparison functions
   - Remove complex diffing algorithms
   - Keep only essential utilities

4. Defer Features
   - Complex metrics tracking
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Advanced optimization strategies
   - Complex state diffing

### Phase 2: Testing

- Focus on basic functionality tests
- Remove complex test scenarios initially
- Test common use cases first
- Keep test setup simple

### Phase 3: Documentation

- Clear, simple API documentation
- Basic usage examples
- Remove complex optimization guides initially

## Benefits

- Faster initial implementation
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Clear upgrade path for future optimization
- Better foundation for testing

## Future Enhancements

Once basic functionality is proven:

1. Add advanced comparison logic
2. Implement metrics tracking
3. Add benchmarking
4. Enhance optimization strategies

This approach follows the principle of "make it work, make it right, make it fast" - focusing first on basic working functionality before optimization.
