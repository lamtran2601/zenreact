# Implementation Tasks Breakdown

## Phase 0: Project Structure Setup

- [ ] **Directory Structure**
  - Create packages/core/src/hooks directory
  - Create packages/core/src/hoc directory
  - Ensure proper directory organization

## Phase 1: Basic Implementation

### 1. Simplify useOptimizedState Hook

- [ ] **Initial Setup**

  - Create initial hook file at packages/core/src/hooks/useOptimizedState.ts
  - Set up types directory if not exists
  - Add hook exports to index.ts

- [ ] **Basic State Implementation**

  - Implement basic useState wrapper
  - Add simple equality comparison
  - Add type definitions for basic state management
  - Keep implementation focused on core functionality

- [ ] **Testing Setup**
  - Create useOptimizedState.test.tsx in **tests** directory
  - Implement basic test cases
  - Test core functionality
  - Ensure test coverage for common use cases

### 2. Simplify withOptimization HOC

- [ ] **Initial Setup**

  - Create HOC file at packages/core/src/hoc/withOptimization.ts
  - Set up necessary type definitions
  - Add HOC exports to index.ts

- [ ] **Basic HOC Implementation**

  - Implement basic component wrapping
  - Add simple prop comparison logic
  - Keep optimization strategies minimal
  - Add type definitions for component wrapping

- [ ] **Testing Setup**
  - Create withOptimization.test.tsx in **tests** directory
  - Implement basic test cases
  - Test prop comparison functionality
  - Ensure test coverage for common wrapping cases

### 3. Simplify Utils

- [ ] **Review and Cleanup**

  - Review current utils in packages/core/src/utils/
  - Identify essential utility functions
  - Remove unnecessary complexity

- [ ] **Basic Utils Implementation**

  - Focus on essential comparison functions
  - Implement simplified equality checks
  - Keep helper functions minimal
  - Ensure proper type definitions

- [ ] **Testing Setup**
  - Update/create tests in utils/**tests**/
  - Focus on core functionality tests
  - Ensure good coverage of basic operations

### 4. Integration and Cleanup

- [ ] **Main Exports**

  - Update packages/core/src/index.ts
  - Ensure proper type exports
  - Remove unused exports
  - Verify export organization

- [ ] **Package Configuration**
  - Update package.json
  - Review and update dependencies
  - Ensure build configuration is correct
  - Update tsconfig.json if needed

### 5. Documentation

- [ ] **API Documentation**

  - Document useOptimizedState hook
  - Document withOptimization HOC
  - Document utility functions
  - Add simple usage examples

- [ ] **Migration Guide**
  - Document changes from complex to simple implementation
  - Provide upgrade path guidance
  - Add troubleshooting section

## Implementation Priority Order

1. Project structure setup
2. Basic utility functions (needed by other components)
3. useOptimizedState hook implementation
4. withOptimization HOC implementation
5. Integration and testing
6. Documentation updates

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow "make it work" first principle
2. Keep implementations simple and focused
3. Comment key decisions
4. Write tests alongside implementation
5. Update documentation as you go
6. Commit working pieces frequently

## Definition of Done
