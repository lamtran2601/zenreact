# Next Steps for ZenReact

## Current Status

- Core optimization utilities have been successfully simplified and implemented
- Basic project structure is in place
- Initial documentation including migration guide is complete
- Basic testing is implemented

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Complete Monorepo Setup

- Review current monorepo configuration
- Ensure all necessary scripts are in package.json
- Verify workspace setup in pnpm-workspace.yaml
- Document monorepo structure and conventions

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

- Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- Configure build pipeline
- Add automated testing
- Implement release automation
- Add code coverage reporting

### 3. Testing Framework Enhancement

- Expand test coverage for edge cases
- Add integration tests
- Implement performance benchmarks
- Add browser compatibility tests

### 4. New Feature Development

- Implement createOptimizedContext utility
  - Design API that matches simplified philosophy
  - Create type definitions
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Add documentation and examples

### 5. Documentation Expansion

- Create detailed API reference documentation
- Add more code examples
- Create getting started guide
- Document best practices
- Add performance optimization guide

## Implementation Priority

1. CI/CD Pipeline (enables automated testing and deployment)
2. Enhanced Testing (ensures reliability)
3. createOptimizedContext (completes core feature set)
4. Documentation Expansion (supports adoption)

## Success Metrics

- All tests passing with >90% coverage
- CI/CD pipeline successfully running
- createOptimizedContext implemented and documented
- Complete documentation suite available

## Next Sprint Planning

Prepare for Sprint 2: Performance Monitoring

- Review monitoring requirements
- Design metrics collection system
- Plan dashboard implementation
