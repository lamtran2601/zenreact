# ZenReact Project Brief

## Project Overview

ZenReact is a comprehensive React performance optimization and monitoring solution designed to help developers build and maintain high-performance React applications with minimal effort.

## Project Goals

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Provide automatic optimization strategies for React components
   - Implement intelligent state management optimization
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimize component lifecycle management

2. **Monitoring & Analytics**

   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Component-level metrics collection
   - Render timing analytics
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Network request monitoring

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Simple, hooks-based API
   - Minimal configuration required
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Strong TypeScript support
   - Automated optimization suggestions

## Architecture Overview

ZenReact is built with a modular architecture consisting of three main packages:

1. **@zenreact/core**

   - Core optimization utilities
   - HOCs and hooks for performance
   - State management optimization
   - Component optimization strategies

2. **@zenreact/monitoring**

   - Performance metrics collection
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Alert system
   - Metric aggregation

3. **@zenreact/server**
   - Server-side components
   - Data persistence
   - API endpoints
   - Configuration management

## Key Technologies

- React 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Jest for testing
- Rollup for bundling
- pnpm for package management

## Development Philosophy

1. **Make it Work**

   - Focus on core functionality
   - Ensure basic features are solid
   - Implement essential optimizations
   - Validate primary use cases

2. **Make it Right**

   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Code quality and maintainability
   - Documentation completeness
   - API consistency

3. **Make it Fast**
   - Performance optimization
   - Resource efficiency
   - Minimal overhead
   - Scalability testing

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**

   - 30% reduction in unnecessary renders
   - 25% improvement in component mount times
   - 20% reduction in memory usage
   - Sub-100ms response times for monitoring

2. **Developer Experience**

   - <5 minute setup time
   - Zero config for basic usage
   - > 90% TypeScript coverage
   - Comprehensive documentation

3. **Code Quality**
   - > 90% test coverage

   - Comprehensive monitoring
   - Dashboard implementation

3. **Phase 3: Polish** (Q3 2025)
   - Performance tuning
   - Documentation completion
   - Community feedback integration

## Memory Bank Integration

The project uses a Memory Bank system to maintain persistent context across development sessions, consisting of:

1. **Core Files**

   - productContext.md: Project overview and technical details
   - activeContext.md: Current session state and active tasks
   - progress.md: Task tracking and sprint progress
   - decisionLog.md: Technical decisions and rationale

2. **Mode-Specific Rules**
   - Architect mode rules
   - Code mode rules
   - Ask mode rules
   - Debug mode rules

This structure ensures consistent context and efficient development across all project phases.
