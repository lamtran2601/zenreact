# ReactAI Assist AI Engine

The AI engine powering ReactAI Assist, providing React-specific code generation, analysis, and recommendations.

## Features

- React component generation from natural language
- Code completion and suggestions
- Anti-pattern detection and refactoring
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Documentation generation
- TypeScript type inference and generation

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch / Hugging Face Transformers
- **API Server**: FastAPI
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone / Milvus
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Testing**: pytest

## Architecture

The AI engine consists of several components:

1. **Request Handler** - Processes incoming requests and manages authentication
2. **Context Analyzer** - Analyzes code context to understand the environment
3. **Model Coordinator** - Selects appropriate models and coordinates inference
4. **Generation Engine** - Generates code and suggestions
5. **Post-Processing** - Formats and validates generated output
6. **Knowledge Base** - Stores and retrieves React patterns and best practices

## Deployment

The AI engine is designed to be deployed as a containerized microservice, using:

- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Prometheus for monitoring
- ELK Stack for logging

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Poetry
- Docker

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Set up pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start the development server
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# With environment variables
ENV_VAR=value poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=app
```

### Building Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t reactai-assist-ai-engine .
```

## API Endpoints

### Component Generation
- `POST /api/v1/generate/component`
  - Generates a React component from a description
  - Supports functional and class components
  - Can include TypeScript types, CSS, and tests

### Code Analysis
- `POST /api/v1/analyze/code`
  - Analyzes React code for anti-patterns and issues
  - Provides recommendations for improvements

### Code Completion
- `POST /api/v1/complete/code`
  - Provides contextual code completions
  - Supports both line and block completions

### Type Generation
- `POST /api/v1/generate/types`
  - Generates TypeScript types for components and functions

## Models

The AI engine uses several specialized models:

1. **Component Generator** - Fine-tuned for React component generation
2. **Code Completer** - Optimized for in-context code completions
3. **Pattern Detector** - Specialized for React anti-pattern detection
4. **Type Inferencer** - Focused on TypeScript type inference
