# React AI Guide

A practical system for enhancing React development with AI tools, optimized for Cursor.

## üéØ Purpose

React AI Guide provides a lightweight, practical framework that helps developers:

- **Accelerate development** with AI-optimized patterns and prompts
- **Maintain consistency** through clearly defined rules and standards
- **Improve quality** with best practices and validation tools
- **Reduce cognitive load** by providing ready-to-use solutions

Unlike complex frameworks or assistants that require extensive infrastructure, this system focuses on practical documentation, patterns, and simple tools that integrate seamlessly with existing workflows and AI coding assistants like Cursor.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Basic Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/react-ai-guide.git

# Navigate to the project
cd react-ai-guide

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
npm install
```

### 2. Start Using Patterns

Browse the pattern library to find solutions for common React development tasks:

- **Component Patterns**: Reusable UI component structures
- **Hook Patterns**: Custom hook implementations for various use cases
- **State Patterns**: Effective state management approaches

### 3. Apply Development Rules

Follow the established rules to ensure code quality and consistency:

- **Code Rules**: Naming, structure, and organization
- **Quality Rules**: Testing, performance, and accessibility
- **TypeScript Rules**: Type definitions and interfaces

### 4. Leverage AI Prompts

Use the optimized prompts with Cursor or other AI tools:

- **Generation Prompts**: Create components, hooks, and tests
- **Refactoring Prompts**: Improve existing code
- **Assistance Prompts**: Get help with debugging and understanding
