# AI-Assisted React Development Workflow

This guide outlines effective workflows for developing React applications with AI assistants like Cursor, focusing on leveraging documentation and patterns rather than traditional scripts or tools.

## Core AI-Assisted Workflow Principles

### 1. Iterative Collaboration with AI

Unlike traditional development workflows that might follow a strict sequence, AI-assisted development works best as a collaborative, iterative process:

1. **Prompt Engineering** - Create clear, detailed requests
2. **Result Evaluation** - Critically evaluate generated code
3. **Refinement** - Provide feedback and refine results
4. **Integration** - Incorporate successful outputs into your codebase
5. **Learning** - Continuously improve your prompting techniques

### 2. Documentation-First Approach

AI assistants work best when they have clear guidance:

1. **Reference Patterns** - Point AI to specific patterns in your prompts
2. **Cite Standards** - Reference specific rules and conventions
3. **Provide Context** - Include relevant project context
4. **Share Examples** - Reference existing similar code

### 3. Feedback Loops

Build effective feedback loops with your AI assistant:

1. **Be Specific** - Clearly identify what needs improvement
2. **Explain Why** - Provide reasoning for changes
3. **Show Examples** - Demonstrate what good looks like
4. **Iterative Refinement** - Use multiple rounds of improvements

## Daily Development Workflows

### Component Creation Workflow

1. **Select Pattern**
   - Identify the appropriate component pattern from the pattern library
   - Review the pattern documentation to understand implementation details

2. **Define Requirements**
   - Document specific requirements for your component
   - Note any variations from the standard pattern

3. **Craft Initial Prompt**
   - Reference the selected pattern explicitly
   - Include specific requirements
   - Mention relevant rules to follow

   Example:
   ```
   Create a ProductCard component based on the Data Display Card pattern in our library.
   The component should:
   - Display product image, name, price, and rating
   - Include "Add to Cart" button
   - Show a badge for sale items
   - Follow our TypeScript rules for proper typing
   - Use our accessibility guidelines for proper ARIA attributes
   ```

4. **Review and Refine Output**
   - Evaluate the generated component against pattern requirements
   - Identify any missing or incorrect implementations
   - Craft targeted follow-up prompts for specific improvements

   Example:
   ```
   The component looks good, but it's missing proper keyboard handling for the "Add to Cart" button
   and doesn't include the badge styling from our pattern. Please update to address these issues.
   ```

5. **Integration and Testing**
   - Integrate the final component into your codebase
   - Test against accessibility standards
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Ensure performance meets requirements

### Refactoring Workflow

1. **Identify Improvement Areas**
   - Review existing component against patterns and rules
   - Note specific issues to address

2. **Reference Appropriate Rules**
   - Find relevant rules in the documentation
   - Understand the rationale behind the rules

3. **Craft Refactoring Prompt**
   - Include the current code
   - Reference specific rules
   - Explain the desired outcome

   Example:
   ```
   Refactor this UserProfile component to follow our Performance Rules for React components.
   Specifically address:
   - Unnecessary re-renders
   - Proper memoization
   - Optimized event handlers
   
   Here's the current implementation:
   [paste code]
   ```

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with major structural issues
   - Then address optimization
   - Finally, tackle stylistic improvements

5. **Verification**
   - Test performance before and after
   - Ensure functionality remains identical
   - Validate against rules

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Problem Description**
   - Clearly describe the issue
   - Include error messages and stack traces
   - Provide context about when it occurs

2. **Code Context**
   - Share the relevant code sections
   - Include related component interactions
   - Describe expected vs. actual behavior

3. **Craft Debugging Prompt**
   - Reference specific patterns or rules related to the issue
   - Ask for analysis and potential solutions

   Example:
   ```
   This DataTable component is causing a "maximum update depth exceeded" error when sorting is applied.
   The component follows our Data Display Table pattern, but something is wrong with the sort implementation.
   
   Here's the relevant code:
   [paste code]
   
   Please analyze the issue and suggest fixes that align with our state management rules.
   ```

4. **Solution Implementation**
   - Apply suggested fixes
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document the solution for future reference

## Project-Level Workflows

### Component Library Development

1. **Pattern Identification**
   - Review application needs
   - Identify common UI patterns
   - Document pattern requirements

2. **Documentation Creation**
   - Document each pattern thoroughly
   - Include usage guidelines and examples
   - Highlight accessibility considerations

3. **AI-Assisted Implementation**
   - Use documentation to guide AI implementation
   - Create base components following patterns
   - Develop variants and customizations

4. **Validation and Refinement**
   - Test components against requirements
   - Verify accessibility compliance
   - Refine based on usage feedback

### Application Architecture

1. **Structure Planning**
   - Reference architecture patterns
   - Define folder and file organization
   - Document component relationships

2. **AI-Guided Implementation**
   - Use architecture documentation to guide AI
   - Generate scaffolding prompts
   - Create template implementations

3. **Consistency Verification**
   - Review generated code for architectural consistency
   - Refine architecture documentation based on practical implementation
   - Update guidance for future development

## Effective Prompt Patterns

### Component Generation Prompt Pattern

```
Generate a React {component_type} component named "{ComponentName}" following the "{PatternName}" pattern from our documentation.

Specifically, it should:
- {requirement_1}
- {requirement_2}
- {requirement_3}

Technical requirements:
- Follow TypeScript rules with proper interfaces and types
- Implement accessibility according to our guidelines
- Include proper error handling and loading states
- Follow our naming conventions

Here's a similar component for reference:
{example_code}
```

### Refactoring Prompt Pattern

```
Refactor this {component_type} component to follow our "{RuleName}" rule.
The current implementation has issues with {specific_issue}.

Current code:
{current_code}

Please improve the code by:
- {improvement_1}
- {improvement_2}
- {improvement_3}

Maintain all existing functionality while improving the implementation.
```

### Architecture Prompt Pattern

```
Help me implement a {feature_name} feature following our "{ArchitecturePattern}" architecture pattern.

The feature requires:
- {requirement_1}
- {requirement_2}
- {requirement_3}

Following our architecture pattern, please:
1. Outline the necessary components and their relationships
2. Suggest the folder structure and file organization
3. Provide implementation guidance for key components

This should align with our existing patterns for {similar_feature}.
```

## Learning and Improvement

### Prompt Refinement

Keep a record of effective prompts and continuously refine them:

1. Track which prompts produce the best results
2. Note specific phrases that lead to better outcomes
3. Develop a personal library of proven prompts

### Pattern Evolution

As you work with AI tools, evolve your patterns:

1. Note which patterns are easily implemented by AI
2. Identify patterns that require more guidance
3. Refine documentation based on AI collaboration experiences

### Knowledge Sharing

Build a team knowledge base:

1. Share effective prompts with team members
2. Document successful AI collaboration workflows
3. Develop shared standards for AI-assisted development
