# Workflow Guide

This guide outlines recommended workflows for integrating React AI Guide into your daily development process. It provides practical approaches for different development scenarios, from creating new components to debugging existing code.

## Development Workflow Overview

The React AI Guide system is designed to enhance your development workflow in several ways:

1. **Planning**: Use patterns as blueprints for implementation
2. **Implementation**: Use AI prompts to generate code based on patterns
3. **Validation**: Use rules to verify code quality
4. **Refinement**: Use AI to improve implementation
5. **Documentation**: Use documentation templates to record decisions and usage

## Everyday Development Scenarios

### Creating a New Component

#### 1. Pattern Selection

Start by selecting the appropriate component pattern from the pattern library:

1. Browse the `patterns/components/` directory for relevant patterns
2. Review the chosen pattern's documentation thoroughly
3. Note specific requirements and best practices

#### 2. Component Planning

Plan your component implementation:

1. Identify required props and state
2. Determine UI structure and behavior
3. Note any variations from the standard pattern
4. Consider accessibility requirements

#### 3. AI-Assisted Implementation

Use AI to help implement the component:

1. Open Cursor AI
2. Craft a prompt referencing the specific pattern
3. Include your component's specific requirements
4. Request implementation with proper TypeScript types

Example prompt:
```
Generate a React component called ProductCard following the "Data Display Card" pattern from our pattern library.

The component should:
- Display product image, name, price, and description
- Have an "Add to Cart" button
- Show different badges for "Sale", "New", or "Limited" items
- Follow proper TypeScript usage with interfaces
- Include appropriate accessibility attributes

Please structure the component following our TypeScript rules, with props interface and proper typing.
```

#### 4. Code Review and Refinement

Review and refine the generated code:

1. Verify pattern compliance
2. Check TypeScript types
3. Review accessibility features
4. Test the component's functionality
5. Use additional AI prompts to address any issues

Example refinement prompt:
```
The ProductCard component looks good, but I noticed these issues:
1. The image doesn't have proper alt attributes
2. The price formatting doesn't handle currency properly
3. The Add to Cart button needs better keyboard support

Please update the component to address these issues.
```

#### 5. Component Integration

Integrate the component into your application:

1. Place the component in the appropriate directory
2. Add any necessary stylesheets
3. Import and use the component
4. Test in different scenarios
5. Document usage examples

### Refactoring Existing Code

#### 1. Problem Identification

Identify issues in the existing implementation:

1. Compare against relevant patterns
2. Check rule compliance
3. Note performance or accessibility issues
4. Document specific problems to address

#### 2. Pattern Reference

Identify the appropriate pattern to guide refactoring:

1. Select the pattern that best matches the component's purpose
2. Note differences between current implementation and pattern
3. Determine which pattern aspects should be applied

#### 3. AI-Assisted Refactoring

Use AI to help with the refactoring:

1. Share the current code with the AI
2. Reference the specific pattern and rules to follow
3. Highlight the issues to address
4. Request a refactored implementation

Example prompt:
```
I need to refactor this UserProfile component to follow our "Data Display Card" pattern and improve performance.

Current issues:
- Not using memoization for expensive calculations
- Missing proper accessibility attributes
- No TypeScript interfaces for props
- Inconsistent styling approach

Here's the current code:
[Insert code here]

Please refactor this component following our pattern requirements while preserving all functionality.
```

#### 4. Incremental Adoption

Apply changes incrementally:

1. Start with structural changes
2. Add type definitions
3. Implement performance optimizations
4. Enhance accessibility
5. Apply styling improvements

#### 5. Validation

Validate the refactored component:

1. Verify pattern compliance
2. Check rule adherence
3. Test functionality
4. Verify accessibility
5. Measure performance improvements

### Building a New Feature

#### 1. Feature Planning

Plan the feature using appropriate patterns:

1. Identify required components
2. Determine state management approach
3. Plan data flow and interactions
4. Consider error handling and edge cases

#### 2. Architecture Setup

Use architecture patterns to structure the feature:

1. Set up folder structure following architecture patterns
2. Create placeholder files for components
3. Define interfaces for data models
4. Plan component relationships

Example prompt:
```
I'm building a user management feature with the following requirements:
- User listing with search and filter
- User details view
- User editing capabilities
- Permission management

Based on our "Feature-Based Organization" architecture pattern, help me plan the folder structure, component breakdown, and data flow for this feature.
```

#### 3. Component Implementation

Implement components using their respective patterns:

1. Use the Data Display pattern for the user listing
2. Use the Form pattern for user editing
3. Use the Detail View pattern for user details
4. Implement each component using AI-assisted workflows

#### 4. State Management

Implement state management following appropriate patterns:

1. Choose between local state, context, or external state management
2. Implement state management following the selected pattern
3. Connect components to state
4. Test state updates and interactions

#### 5. Integration and Testing

Integrate components and test the feature:

1. Connect all components
2. Test user flows
3. Verify error handling
4. Check responsive behavior
5. Validate accessibility

### Debugging Issues

#### 1. Problem Exploration

Use AI to help understand and diagnose issues:

1. Clearly describe the issue
2. Share relevant code and error messages
3. Note expected vs. actual behavior

Example prompt:
```
I have a React component that's causing a performance issue. The UserTable component re-renders all rows whenever a single row is selected.

Here's the component code:
[Insert code here]

Can you help identify what's causing the unnecessary re-renders and suggest how to fix it based on our Performance Optimization patterns?
```

#### 2. Pattern-Based Solutions

Use patterns to guide the solution:

1. Identify patterns relevant to the issue (e.g., Performance Optimization pattern)
2. Compare current implementation against pattern requirements
3. Note specific pattern principles that would address the issue

#### 3. AI-Assisted Debugging

Use AI to implement fixes:

1. Share diagnosis with AI
2. Reference specific patterns and rules
3. Request specific fixes

Example prompt:
```
Based on your analysis, please implement the fix for the UserTable component following our Performance Optimization pattern, specifically:
1. Memoize the row component
2. Use useCallback for event handlers
3. Implement proper dependency arrays
4. Extract state that causes frequent changes

Please update the code to address these issues.
```

#### 4. Testing and Verification

Validate the fixes:

1. Implement the suggested changes
2. Test to verify the issue is resolved
3. Check for any new issues introduced
4. Validate performance improvement
