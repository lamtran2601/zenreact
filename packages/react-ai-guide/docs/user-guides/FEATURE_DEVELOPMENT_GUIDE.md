# Iterative Feature Development with AI Assistance

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use AI assistants like Cursor to iteratively develop React features from simple requirements. The process emphasizes conversation, iteration, and minimal initial specifications to maximize AI assistance and minimize manual coding.

## The Iterative AI Development Process

Traditional development requires extensive upfront planning. With AI assistance, you can follow a more dynamic process:

1. **Initial Request**: Start with a minimal feature description
2. **Exploration Dialog**: Clarify and expand requirements through conversation
3. **Implementation Generation**: Have the AI generate initial code
4. **Review & Refinement**: Give feedback and request adjustments
5. **Integration & Testing**: Add the code to your project and test
6. **Enhancement**: Iteratively improve through continued conversation

## Starting with Minimal Requirements

The ideal starting point is a short, clear description of what you want to achieve. Your initial request should:

- **Describe the feature purpose** - What problem does it solve?
- **Outline key functionality** - What should it do?
- **Mention technical context** - What's your tech stack?
- **Define boundaries** - Any constraints or requirements?

### Example Initial Request

```
I need a shopping cart feature for an e-commerce React app.
Users should be able to add/remove products and adjust quantities.
We use React with TypeScript, Context API for state, and Tailwind for styling.
```

## The Exploration Dialog

After your initial request, engage in dialog with the AI to explore and clarify requirements. This is where you progressively define the feature without having to specify everything upfront.

### Effective Dialog Techniques

1. **Answer clarifying questions** the AI asks about your requirements
2. **Make decisions progressively** as the AI presents options
3. **Add requirements incrementally** rather than all at once
4. **Use examples** to illustrate desired behavior
5. **Reference existing patterns** when applicable

### Example Dialog Flow

**AI:** "Should the cart persist between sessions? And would you like to implement a sliding side panel or a separate page for the cart?"

**You:** "Yes, the cart should persist in localStorage. A sliding side panel would be perfect for the cart UI."

**AI:** "Do you want to include product images and price calculations in the cart? Should there be a checkout button?"

**You:** "Yes to all three. The cart should show thumbnail images, calculate subtotals and total, and have a checkout button that links to '/checkout'."

## Implementation Generation

The AI will generate code based on your conversation. For complex features, this typically happens in stages:

1. **Architecture proposal** - The AI outlines the approach
2. **Core implementation** - Initial code for the main feature
3. **Additional components** - Supporting elements and variations
4. **Integration examples** - How to use the feature in your app

### Implementation Review Tips

When reviewing generated code:

1. **Check the overall approach** before diving into details
2. **Look for edge cases** that might not be handled
3. **Verify type safety** in TypeScript implementations
4. **Consider accessibility** requirements
5. **Check for best practices** in React patterns

## The Refinement Cycle

The real power of AI assistance comes from the refinement cycle. Instead of getting everything perfect in one go, you can iteratively improve the implementation.

### Effective Refinement Requests

1. **Be specific about changes**: "Let's modify the cart to support saved items for later"
2. **Request enhancements**: "Add animation when items are added or removed"
3. **Ask for optimizations**: "Can we memoize these components for better performance?"
4. **Request additions**: "Add a 'Continue Shopping' button that closes the cart panel"
5. **Fix issues**: "The quantity shouldn't accept negative values"

### Example Refinement Dialog

**You:** "This looks good, but I notice the cart doesn't handle out-of-stock products. Can we add a check against a product's available inventory?"

**AI:** *Generates updated code with inventory checks*

**You:** "Perfect. Now let's add a visual indicator for items with low stock (less than 5 available)."

**AI:** *Updates code with low stock indicators*

## Complete Feature Development Example

Let's walk through a complete example of developing a "Product Filtering System" feature.

### Initial Request

```
I need a product filtering system for our e-commerce React app.
Users should be able to filter products by category, price range, and ratings.
We use React with TypeScript and Zustand for state management.
```

### Exploration Dialog

**AI:** "Would you like the filters to be applied automatically or after clicking an 'Apply' button? And should the URL reflect the active filters for sharing/bookmarking?"

**You:** "Apply filters automatically as users select them, and yes, the URL should update with query parameters."

**AI:** "Do you want to support multiple selections within a category (e.g., selecting both 'Electronics' and 'Clothing')?"

**You:** "Yes, categories should support multiple selections. Price should be a range with min/max values."

### Initial Implementation

*The AI generates core components:*
- FilterContainer component
- CategoryFilter component
- PriceRangeFilter component
- RatingFilter component
- useProductFilters custom hook
- FilterContext for state management

### First Refinement

**You:** "This looks great! Can we add a 'Clear All Filters' button and make the active filters display as removable tags at the top?"

*AI updates the implementation with these features*

### Second Refinement

**You:** "I notice the price filter doesn't remember the last selection. Can we fix that and also add a mobile-friendly view for the filters?"

*AI makes these adjustments*

### Third Refinement

**You:** "Let's improve performance by debouncing the price filter and memoizing filtered results."

*AI optimizes the implementation*

### Final Implementation

**You:** "This looks perfect! One last thing - can you show me how to integrate this with our product listing page?"

*AI provides integration example*

## Best Practices for Iterative AI Development

1. **Start simple, add complexity**: Begin with core functionality, then expand
2. **Break large features into steps**: Develop complex features in manageable chunks
3. **Reference existing code**: Point to similar features in your codebase
4. **Document key decisions**: Take notes on important choices for future reference
5. **Test progressively**: Integrate and test components as they're developed
6. **Trust but verify**: AI can be very capable but always review for correctness

## Handling Common Challenges

### When the AI misunderstands your architecture

"Let me clarify our application architecture. We use [describe pattern]. Can you adjust the implementation to follow this pattern?"

### When the generated code doesn't match your code style

"This functionality is good, but could you update the code to match our project's style? Here's an example of a similar component from our codebase: [paste example]"

### When you need to pivot the approach

"I see that this approach might have limitations. Let's try a different approach where [describe alternative]."

## Advanced Techniques

### Using Placeholders for Complex Logic

For business logic that's too complex to explain, use placeholder functions:

"Generate the component structure, but for the pricing calculation, just create a placeholder function called `calculateDiscountedPrice` that I'll implement later."

### Developing in Layers

Break down complex features into conceptual layers:

1. **Data layer**: State management, API integration
2. **Component structure**: Layout and organization
3. **Interaction layer**: User events and behaviors 
4. **Styling layer**: Visual design and animations
5. **Optimization layer**: Performance improvements

### Combining AI-Generated Code with Existing Code

When integrating with existing features:

1. Show the AI examples of the existing code
2. Have the AI generate integration points
3. Identify any refactoring needed in existing code

## Conclusion

Iterative feature development with AI assistance allows you to:

- Start development with minimal specifications
- Explore options through conversation
- Build features incrementally
- Focus on decision-making rather than implementation details

This approach significantly reduces the manual coding required while still giving you full control over the final implementation. The key is to view development as a conversation where you guide the AI through progressive refinement rather than trying to specify everything perfectly from the start.
