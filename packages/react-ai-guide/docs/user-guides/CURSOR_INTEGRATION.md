# Cursor AI Integration Guide

This guide shows how to effectively use React AI Guide with Cursor AI to maximize your development productivity. Cursor's AI capabilities paired with our structured patterns and prompts create a powerful development workflow.

## Why Cursor + React AI Guide?

Cursor is a code editor with integrated AI capabilities that can:

- Generate code based on natural language prompts
- Explain and refactor existing code
- Answer questions about your codebase
- Provide intelligent code completions

React AI Guide enhances these capabilities by providing:

- Structured patterns that guide AI generation
- Optimized prompts for React development
- Standardized rules for code quality
- Templates that serve as starting points

Together, they create a powerful workflow that balances AI assistance with consistent, high-quality code.

## Getting Started with Cursor

### 1. Install Cursor

If you haven't already, download and install Cursor from [https://cursor.sh/](https://cursor.sh/)

### 2. Open Your React Project

Open your React project in Cursor:

```bash
# From the command line
cursor /path/to/your/project

# Or open Cursor and use File > Open
```

### 3. Set Up React AI Guide

Make sure React AI Guide is accessible in your project:

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/your-org/react-ai-guide.git

# You can clone it directly into your project or keep it in a separate location
```

## Effective Prompt Techniques

### Basic Prompting

To get started with basic AI assistance:

1. **Press Ctrl+K / Cmd+K** to open the command prompt
2. **Enter your question or request** in natural language
3. **Press Enter** to get a response

### Enhanced Prompting with React AI Guide

For better results, reference patterns and rules from React AI Guide:

1. **Open the relevant pattern or rule** document
2. **Copy the pattern description or key points**
3. **Include them in your prompt to Cursor**

Example:

```
I need to create a React form component following the "Controlled Form Pattern" 
described in our pattern library with:

- Centralized form state
- Field-level validation
- Submission handling with loading state
- Error message display

The form needs to collect user name, email, and a message, with email validation.
```

### Using Template References

Reference templates for more structure:

```
Please create a custom hook based on the "Data Fetching Hook Pattern" from our template 
library. The hook should:

- Fetch user data from our API
- Handle loading, error, and success states
- Support pagination
- Include TypeScript types
```

## Command Palette Integration

Cursor's command palette (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P) can be used to quickly access React AI Guide resources:

### Example Commands

- **"React Pattern: Component"** - Access component patterns
- **"React Pattern: Hook"** - Access hook patterns
- **"React Rule: TypeScript"** - Access TypeScript rules

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New Component

Let's create a new component using Cursor AI with React AI Guide:

1. **Open a new file** where you want to create your component

2. **Press Ctrl+K / Cmd+K** and use this enhanced prompt:

```
I need to create a React component for a ProductCard following our "Data Display Card" pattern.

Key pattern requirements:
- Clear visual hierarchy with main and supporting information
- Contained interactive elements
- Consistent spacing and styling
- Responsive behavior
- Accessible structure

Component requirements:
- Display product image, name, price, and description
- Include "Add to Cart" button
- Show availability status
- Use TypeScript
- Follow our project's naming convention (PascalCase)
- Include JSDoc comments

Please generate the full component implementation.
```

3. **Review and refine the generated code**
   - Check that it follows the pattern requirements
   - Ensure proper TypeScript types
   - Verify accessibility features

4. **Save the file** in the appropriate directory

### Example 2: Refactoring Existing Code

Use Cursor to help refactor code with pattern guidance:

1. **Select the code** you want to refactor

2. **Press Ctrl+K / Cmd+K** and use this pattern-based prompt:

```
Please refactor this component to follow our "Performance Optimized Component" pattern:

Key requirements:
- Use React.memo for the component
- Extract event handlers to useCallback
- Move expensive calculations to useMemo
- Ensure proper dependency arrays
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

The component currently has performance issues because it re-renders too often.
```

3. **Review the suggested changes**
   - Compare with the original code
   - Check that all functionality is preserved
   - Verify performance improvements

4. **Apply the refactored code** to your component

### Example 3: Creating a Custom Hook

Create a custom hook with pattern guidance:

1. **Open a new file** for your hook

2. **Press Ctrl+K / Cmd+K** and use this pattern-based prompt:

```
I need to create a custom React hook called useLocalStorage that follows our "Persistent State Hook" pattern.

Key pattern requirements:
- Mimics useState API for familiarity
- Handles serialization and deserialization automatically
- Includes error handling for storage failures
- Updates across multiple components using the same key
- TypeScript type safety

The hook should store and retrieve values from localStorage with proper type checking.
```

3. **Review and refine the generated hook**
   - Check for proper error handling
   - Verify TypeScript types
   - Test the hook functionality

4. **Save the file** in your hooks directory

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Step Development

For complex features, break development into steps:

1. **Start with architecture**:
   ```
   Based on our "Feature Architecture" pattern, please outline the component structure for 
   a user dashboard feature with: profile section, activity feed, and settings panel.
   ```

2. **Generate individual components**:
   ```
   Now, please implement the ProfileSection component based on the architecture we just discussed.
   ```

3. **Connect components**:
   ```
   Please show how these components should be composed in the main Dashboard component.
   ```

### Code Explanation

Use Cursor to explain code based on your patterns:

```
Please explain this component in terms of our React patterns and rules. 
Identify which patterns it's using and any rule violations:

[paste your code here]
```

### Learning Patterns

Use Cursor to learn about patterns:

```
Please explain the "Compound Component Pattern" in React with a simple example.
What are its key benefits and when should I use it?
```

## Troubleshooting

### Improving AI Responses

If you're not getting good results:

1. **Be more specific** about the pattern requirements
2. **Provide more context** about your project
3. **Include relevant code snippets** for reference
4. **Break complex requests** into smaller steps

### Common Issues

- **Inconsistent code style**: Specify your preferred style in the prompt
- **Missing TypeScript types**: Explicitly request proper typing
- **Incomplete implementations**: Ask for specific missing pieces
- **Pattern misinterpretation**: Provide more details about the pattern

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Useful Cursor keyboard shortcuts for AI interaction:

- **Ctrl+K / Cmd+K**: Open AI command prompt
- **Ctrl+L / Cmd+L**: Explain selected code
- **Ctrl+I / Cmd+I**: Generate code inline
- **Esc**: Cancel AI operation
