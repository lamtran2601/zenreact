### Autonomous Development Approach

For teams using AI assistants like Cursor AI, we offer an autonomous development approach that leverages specialized guides:

1. **Set Up Autonomous Guides**
   - Create an `.ai-assistant/guides` directory in your project
   - Copy the following guides into that directory:
     - `SELF_CONTEXT_GUIDE.md` - For project structure analysis
     - `DECISION_FRAMEWORKS.md` - For architectural decisions
     - `SELF_REVIEW_CHECKLISTS.md` - For code quality verification
     - `AUTOMATED_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - For test generation

2. **Initialize with Project Analysis**
   - Ask your AI assistant to analyze your project:
     ```
     Please analyze this project using the Self-Context Guide in .ai-assistant/guides to understand our code patterns and structure.
     ```

3. **Develop with Autonomous Guidance**
   - For component creation:
     ```
     Create a [component] following the Decision Frameworks guide, then review it with the Self-Review Checklists.
     ```
   - For testing:
     ```
     Generate tests for this code using the Automated Testing Guide.
     ```

4. **Standardize with Cursor Integration**
   - For consistent application of the autonomous workflow, follow the [Cursor Integration for Autonomous Development](../autonomous/CURSOR_INTEGRATION.md) guide
   - This includes:
     - Configuration files to standardize workflow
     - Keyboard shortcuts for common AI commands
     - Automated scripts for workflow enforcement
     - Templates and pre-commit hooks

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New Component

Let's create a new component using the system:

1. **Consult Component Patterns**
   - Browse [Component Patterns](../../patterns/components/) to find an appropriate pattern
   - Let's say you choose the "Data Display Card" pattern

2. **Use a Generation Prompt**
   - Find the component generation prompt in [Component Prompts](../../prompts/generation/COMPONENT.md)
   - Customize it for your specific needs:

```
I need to create a React component for a "ProductCard" following the Data Display Card pattern.
The component should:
- Display product image, name, price, and a short description
- Have a "Add to Cart" button
- Show a badge for sale items
- Use TypeScript for type definitions
- Follow the project's naming and structure conventions

Please provide the implementation with appropriate types, styles, and tests.
```

3. **Apply Generated Code**
   - Use the code generated by your AI assistant
   - Customize it further as needed
   - Place it in your project following structure guidelines

### Example 2: Refactoring Existing Code

Let's refactor an existing component:

1. **Identify Issues**
   - Review your component against [Code Rules](../../rules/code/)
   - Note areas for improvement

2. **Use Refactoring Prompts**
   - Find appropriate prompts in [Refactoring Prompts](../../prompts/refactoring/)
   - Customize a prompt for your specific needs:

```
I have a React component that needs refactoring to improve performance.
The component is re-rendering too often due to unnecessary state updates.
Please help optimize it using memoization and proper dependency arrays.

Here's the current implementation:

[paste your component code here]
```

3. **Apply Refactored Code**
   - Review the suggested changes from your AI assistant
   - Apply the optimized implementation
   - Test the component to ensure it maintains functionality

### Example 3: Creating a Custom Hook

Let's create a custom hook:

1. **Consult Hook Patterns**
   - Browse [Hook Patterns](../../patterns/hooks/) to find relevant patterns
   - Choose an appropriate pattern for your needs

2. **Use Hook Template**
   - Find the hook template in [Hook Templates](../../templates/hooks/)
   - Customize it for your specific use case

3. **Implement and Test**
   - Create the hook implementation
   - Write tests to ensure it works correctly
   - Document the hook following the project's standards

## Common Questions

### How do I decide which pattern to use?

Start by identifying your specific need (UI component, state management, etc.). Then browse the relevant pattern category and look for patterns that solve similar problems. Read the descriptions and examples to find the best match.

### Can I modify patterns to fit my needs?

Absolutely! Patterns are guidelines, not rigid rules. Feel free to adapt them to your specific requirements while maintaining the core principles.

### How do I contribute new patterns?

Follow the guide in [Pattern Development](../technical/PATTERN_DEVELOPMENT.md) to create new patterns. Submit them to your team's repository or contribute them back to the main project.

### How do I use AI assistants effectively with this system?

Review [Cursor Integration](./CURSOR_INTEGRATION.md) for specific guidance on using Cursor AI. The key is to provide clear prompts that reference specific patterns and rules from the system.

## Combining Approaches for Maximum Benefit

The autonomous approach works best when supported by traditional documentation of patterns and rules. Here's how to effectively combine them:

### Why Combine Approaches

1. **Complementary Strengths**: 
   - Traditional documentation provides detailed explanations and examples
   - Autonomous guides provide AI-specific frameworks and decision trees
   
2. **Knowledge Foundation**: 
   - Traditional patterns and rules form the knowledge foundation
   - Autonomous guides help AI apply that knowledge effectively

3. **Team Alignment**:
   - Having both ensures all team members (human and AI) work from the same standards
   - Creates consistency regardless of whether code is written manually or via AI

### Practical Integration Strategies

1. **Reference Traditional Docs in AI Prompts**:
   ```
   Using the Button Component Pattern from our pattern library and applying the Decision Frameworks guide, create a custom button component for our checkout flow.
   ```

2. **Enhance Pattern Docs with AI Usage Notes**:
   Add sections to pattern documentation that explain how AI can effectively implement the pattern.

3. **Cross-Reference System**:
   Ensure autonomous guides reference specific patterns and rules from traditional documentation.

4. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   Start with traditional documentation and gradually introduce autonomous guides as your team becomes comfortable with AI assistance.

### Example Combined Workflow

1. **Pattern Selection**: Use traditional documentation to select appropriate patterns
2. **Implementation Plan**: Use Decision Frameworks to plan implementation details
3. **Code Generation**: Use AI with prompts referencing both systems
4. **Quality Check**: Use Self-Review Checklists that incorporate project-specific rules
5. **Testing**: Generate tests using the Automated Testing Guide while following test patterns

## Next Steps

After getting comfortable with the basics:

1. Explore the [Workflow Guide](./WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for integrating the system into your daily workflow
2. Learn about [Cursor Integration](./CURSOR_INTEGRATION.md) for optimizing AI assistant usage
4. Review [Technical Documentation](../technical/) for extending and customizing the system
5. Explore [Autonomous Development Guides](../autonomous/README.md) to enhance AI-driven workflows
