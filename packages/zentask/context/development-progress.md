## Implementation Decisions
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 2025-03-28 | Tailwind CSS 4 with DaisyUI 5 | Latest version with improved features and configuration | Earlier versions, other UI libraries |
| 2025-03-28 | CSS-first configuration for Tailwind | Follows new Tailwind CSS 4 approach | JavaScript configuration |
| 2025-03-28 | Feature-based architecture | Provides clear boundaries and encapsulation | Page-based, atomic design |
| 2025-03-28 | Mandatory AI implementation sequence | Ensures consistent, high-quality implementations with proper planning | Ad-hoc implementation approach |
| 2025-03-28 | Task management with tabs | Provides organized UI for managing both tasks and categories | Separate pages for each feature |
| 2025-03-28 | Tag-based task organization | Enables flexible task organization and filtering | Hierarchical categories only |
| 2025-03-28 | Task sorting functionality | Provides better organization and findability of tasks | Fixed sort order |
| 2025-03-28 | Detailed task view | Provides comprehensive task information without modal dialogs | Modal-based detailed view |

## Roadblocks and Solutions
| Issue | Solution | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Tailwind CSS 4 and DaisyUI 5 integration | Created detailed configuration plan | Planned |
| Inconsistent AI implementation approach | Created mandatory implementation sequence | Implemented |

## Next Steps
1. Implement testing for task components
2. Integrate with server-side API
3. Implement authentication features
4. Implement user profile management
5. Implement dashboard with improved visualizations
6. Implement drag and drop for task reordering
7. Add dark/light mode theming
