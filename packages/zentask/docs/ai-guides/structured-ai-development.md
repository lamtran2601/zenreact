# Structured AI Development Workflow

This guide reinforces the critical practice of **planning and documenting first, coding later** for AI assistants working on the ZenTask application. Following this structured approach ensures consistent quality, proper context maintenance, and alignment with project standards.

## The Plan-Document-Code Paradigm

### Why Planning and Documentation First?

AI assistants must resist jumping directly to code implementation for several reasons:

1. **Context Preservation**: Proper planning ensures all contextual information is captured and maintained
2. **Architectural Consistency**: Documentation-first approach ensures alignment with existing patterns
3. **Reduced Rework**: Thorough planning minimizes the need for major revisions
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Documented plans facilitate collaboration between developers and AI assistants
5. **Higher Quality**: Structured approach leads to more robust, maintainable solutions

### Signs of Insufficient Planning

Watch for these warning signs that indicate insufficient planning:

- Jumping directly to code implementation before understanding requirements
- Missing context about related components and files
- Implementing solutions without considering existing patterns
- Neglecting to document rationale for implementation decisions
- Making assumptions without explicit verification

## Required Planning Artifacts

Before writing any code, AI assistants must produce the following artifacts:

### 1. Requirement Analysis Document

```markdown
## Requirement Analysis

### Feature/Task Overview
[Brief description of the feature or task]

### Core Requirements
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

### Constraints
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

### Questions and Clarifications
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

### Success Criteria
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
```

### 2. Implementation Plan

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Component Architecture
- [Component structure and relationships]
- [Component hierarchy diagram if applicable]

### State Management Approach
- [State requirements]
- [Chosen state management solution with rationale]
- [State update patterns]

### API Integration (if applicable)
- [API endpoints to be used]
- [Data transformation requirements]
- [Error handling strategy]

### Implementation Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Technical Decisions
- [Decision 1] - [Rationale]
- [Decision 2] - [Rationale]

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- [Edge case 1] - [Handling approach]
- [Edge case 2] - [Handling approach]
```

### 3. Context Maintenance Object

```json
{
  "project_context": {
    "feature_area": "[Feature area name]",
    "related_components": ["ComponentA", "ComponentB"],
    "related_files": ["path/to/file1.tsx", "path/to/file2.ts"],
    "component_hierarchy": ["App > Layout > FeatureComponent"],
    "state_dependencies": ["useStore1", "useQuery1"]
  },
  "implementation_context": {
    "current_phase": "planning",
    "task_breakdown": [
      {"task": "[Task 1]", "status": "pending"},
      {"task": "[Task 2]", "status": "pending"}
    ],
    "patterns_to_follow": [
      {"pattern": "[Pattern 1]", "reference": "[File reference]"},
      {"pattern": "[Pattern 2]", "reference": "[File reference]"}
    ]
  },
  "decision_log": [
    {
      "decision": "[Decision made]",
      "rationale": "[Reasoning]",
      "alternatives": ["Alternative A", "Alternative B"],
      "constraints": ["Constraint 1", "Constraint 2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Structured Development Process

### Phase 1: Planning (Required)

1. **Analyze Request**
   - Fully understand the requirements and constraints
   - Identify the feature area and core functionality
   - Note dependencies and integration points

2. **Research Existing Patterns**
   - Review similar components or features
   - Identify reusable patterns and approaches
   - Document relevant code references

3. **Create Planning Artifacts**
   - Develop Requirement Analysis Document
   - Create Implementation Plan
   - Initialize Context Maintenance Object

### Phase 2: Documentation (Required)

1. **Component Documentation**
   - Document component purpose and responsibility
   - Define props interface with JSDoc comments
   - Specify component behaviors and states

2. **State Management Documentation**
   - Document state structure
   - Define state update patterns
   - Document selectors and derived state

3. **Integration Documentation**
   - Document API integrations
   - Define data transformations
   - Specify error handling approaches

### Phase 3: Implementation (After Planning and Documentation)

1. **Framework Creation**
   - Create skeleton implementation
   - Set up file structure
   - Define interfaces and types

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Implement component logic
   - Implement state management
   - Implement API integration

3. **Validation**
   - Review against requirements
   - Check for edge cases
   - Ensure error handling

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update documentation based on implementation
   - Document any deviations from the plan
   - Add code-level documentation

## AI Assistant Checkpoints

AI assistants must verify the following checkpoints before proceeding with implementation:

### Planning Checkpoint ✓
- [ ] Requirements fully understood and documented
- [ ] Implementation plan created with clear steps
- [ ] Context maintenance object initialized
- [ ] Technical decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] Edge cases and error handling planned

### Documentation Checkpoint ✓
- [ ] Component interfaces documented
- [ ] State management approach documented
- [ ] Integration points documented
- [ ] JSDoc comments prepared for implementation

### Implementation Checkpoint ✓
- [ ] Implementation follows the documented plan
- [ ] Code adheres to project patterns and standards
- [ ] Error handling implemented as planned
- [ ] Documentation updated with implementation details

## Example Workflow

### Example Request
"Create a TaskFilter component that allows filtering tasks by status, priority, and due date."

### Step 1: Planning First
```markdown
## Requirement Analysis

### Feature Overview
TaskFilter component to filter tasks by status, priority, and due date.

### Core Requirements
- Filter tasks by status (Todo, In Progress, Completed)
- Filter tasks by priority (Low, Medium, High)
- Filter tasks by due date (Today, This Week, This Month, Overdue)
- Allow multiple filters to be applied simultaneously
- Filters should be applied immediately on selection
- Mobile-responsive design

### Constraints
- Must use existing UI components from the component library
- Must integrate with the existing task store
- Must follow established filtering patterns in the application

### Questions and Clarifications
- Should filter state persist across page navigation?
- Is there a need for a "clear all filters" functionality?

### Success Criteria
- Users can filter tasks using all criteria simultaneously
- UI is consistent with existing application design
- Filter state updates the task list in real-time
- Works correctly on all device sizes
```

### Step 2: Documentation Before Code
```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Component Architecture
- TaskFilter (container component)
  - StatusFilter (presentational)
  - PriorityFilter (presentational)
  - DateFilter (presentational)

### State Management Approach
- Utilize existing useTaskStore for task filtering
- Add filter state to store if not already present
- Use selectors for filtered task lists

### Implementation Steps
1. Review existing filtering components and patterns
2. Extend task store with filter state if needed
3. Create TaskFilter container component
4. Implement individual filter components
5. Connect to task store
6. Add responsive styling
7. Implement filter combinations logic

### Technical Decisions
- Compound component approach - Allows for flexible filter arrangement while maintaining shared state
- Controlled components - All filter state managed by the task store for persistence and shared access
- Debounced filtering - Prevent excessive re-renders on rapid filter changes

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- No tasks matching filters - Show empty state with message
- All filters deselected - Show all tasks
- Filter combinations with no results - Show empty state with clear filters option
```

### Step 3: Only Then Implement
After completing thorough planning and documentation, proceed with implementation following the established plan and patterns.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Premature Implementation**: Starting to code before fully understanding requirements
2. **Incomplete Planning**: Rushing through planning to get to coding
3. **Inadequate Context**: Failing to maintain and update context throughout development
4. **Pattern Deviation**: Not aligning with existing project patterns
5. **Insufficient Documentation**: Not documenting decisions and rationale
6. **Assumption-Based Development**: Making assumptions without verification
7. **Missing Edge Cases**: Not planning for error states and edge cases

## Conclusion

Following this structured Plan-Document-Code approach is **mandatory** for all AI-assisted development in ZenTask. Thorough planning and documentation lead to higher quality code, better maintainability, and more effective collaboration between AI assistants and human developers.

Remember:
- **Planning first** - Understand before implementing
- **Document second** - Capture decisions and approaches
- **Code last** - Implement based on solid planning
