# AI Autonomous Development Guides

This section provides comprehensive guidance for AI assistants working on the ZenTask application. These guides are designed to help AI understand the project context, follow established patterns, and collaborate effectively with human developers.

## Core Guides

### [AI Assistant Guide](./ai-assistant-guide.md)
Comprehensive overview for AI assistants working on ZenTask, including:
- Understanding the ZenTask architecture
- Following established patterns
- Making appropriate decisions
- Collaborating effectively with developers

### [Implementation Techniques](./implementation-techniques.md)
Specific techniques for implementing features in ZenTask:
- Component implementation approach
- State management implementation
- API integration patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### [Context Templates](./context-templates.md)
Templates for providing and maintaining context during development:
- Feature development context
- Bug fixing context
- Refactoring context
- Performance optimization context

### [Troubleshooting with AI](./troubleshooting.md)
Approach to solving issues with AI assistance:
- Debugging workflow
- Issue isolation techniques
- Root cause analysis
- Solution implementation

## How AI Assistants Should Use These Guides

1. **Initial Understanding**: Start with the AI Assistant Guide to understand the overall approach
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Use Context Templates to gather appropriate context
3. **Implementation**: Apply Implementation Techniques to follow established patterns
4. **Problem Solving**: Leverage Troubleshooting with AI for resolving issues

## AI Decision Framework

When making implementation decisions, AI assistants should follow this framework:

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand what needs to be implemented
2. **Identify Patterns**: Determine if there are existing patterns to follow
3. **Select Approach**: Choose the appropriate implementation approach
4. **Plan Implementation**: Break down the implementation into steps
5. **Execute Plan**: Implement the solution following established patterns
6. **Verify Solution**: Ensure the implementation meets requirements and follows standards

## Collaborating with Human Developers

Effective collaboration between AI and human developers is essential:

- **Ask Clarifying Questions**: When context is insufficient
- **Provide Options**: When multiple approaches are viable
- **Explain Reasoning**: When making implementation decisions
- **Highlight Trade-offs**: When there are pros and cons to different approaches
- **Seek Feedback**: When verification is needed

## Continuous Improvement

These guides are designed to evolve as the ZenTask application grows. Feedback from both human developers and AI assistants should be incorporated to improve the guides over time.
