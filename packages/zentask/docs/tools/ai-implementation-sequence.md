## Detailed Implementation Sequence

### 1️⃣ Context Assessment
- Complete the ZenTask Context Assessment Framework
- Ask clarifying questions about task requirements if information is missing
- Explore existing task-related code to understand patterns
- NEVER skip this step - implementation quality depends on proper context

### 2️⃣ State Documentation
- Record current project state using the Context Maintenance Structure
- Document task component hierarchy
- Document task state management approach
- Record integration points with existing ZenReact code

### 3️⃣ Planning Phase
- Classify task components using ZenTask Component Rules
- Select task state management approach using ZenTask State Rules
- Create a step-by-step implementation plan
- Define task interfaces and APIs
- Plan error handling and edge cases for task operations

### 4️⃣ Rule Validation
- Validate plan against ZenTask standards
- Ensure compliance with ZenTask Component Rules
- Verify state management follows ZenTask State Rules
- Check architecture alignment with ZenTask Architecture Rules
- Confirm testing approach follows ZenTask Testing Strategy

### 5️⃣ Implementation
- Follow the plan step-by-step
- Implement each task component following templates
- Apply task state management according to plan
- Add error handling and edge cases for task operations
- Implement tests following Task Test Template

### 6️⃣ Quality Validation
- Complete ZenTask Implementation Checklists
- Verify adherence to ZenTask coding standards
- Ensure proper documentation of task components
- Validate tests cover all task scenarios
- Check accessibility and performance of task interfaces

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Skipping or rushing through any of these steps will result in:
- Poor task management code quality
- Difficult-to-maintain task components
- Inconsistent task architecture
- Inefficient task state management
- Potential bugs and regressions in task operations

## Recovery Process

If implementation has begun without proper planning:
1. STOP immediately
2. Return to Context Assessment
3. Document current progress on task implementation
4. Create a plan for remaining task implementation work
5. Resume implementation following the plan

## Context Maintenance During Implementation

As you implement task features, continuously update:
- Context Maintenance Structure
- Decision history for task implementation
- Implementation progress of task features
- Integration points with ZenReact application

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before considering task implementation complete, verify:
- [ ] Implementation follows the documented plan
- [ ] Code adheres to ZenTask standards
- [ ] All task components follow appropriate templates
- [ ] Task state management follows ZenTask State Rules
- [ ] Tests cover all relevant task scenarios
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met for task interfaces
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed for task operations

Remember: **Never sacrifice quality for speed. Plan first, implement second.**
