# Context Management for Autonomous React Development

Effective context management is the foundation of successful AI-assisted React development. This guide outlines how to establish, maintain, and communicate context throughout the development process.

## What is Development Context?

In AI-assisted development, "context" encompasses:

1. **Project Architecture Context**: Overall structure, patterns, and organization
2. **Component Hierarchy Context**: How components relate and compose together
3. **State Management Context**: How application state flows and is managed
4. **Design System Context**: Visual and interaction patterns
5. **Workflow Context**: Current development goals and focus

## Context Hierarchy for React Projects

### Level 1: Project-Level Context

**Definition**: The highest-level understanding of the project's purpose, architecture, and patterns.

**Key Elements**:
- Project goals and requirements
- Overall architecture approach
- Main libraries and dependencies
- Folder structure and organization
- Coding standards and conventions
- Build and deployment processes

**How to Establish**:
```
"This is a React application for managing customer relationships. It uses:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite as the build tool
- Zustand for global state
- React Router for navigation
- Styled-components for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- Vitest and Testing Library for testing

Our folder structure follows a feature-based organization where each feature has its own components, hooks, and tests."
```

### Level 2: Feature-Level Context

**Definition**: Understanding of a specific feature's purpose, components, and state.

**Key Elements**:
- Feature requirements and user stories
- Component composition within the feature
- Feature-specific state management
- API interactions for the feature
- Feature-specific business logic

**How to Establish**:
```
"We're working on the UserDashboard feature which:
- Shows user activity analytics
- Allows management of user preferences
- Displays notifications and alerts
- Contains 5 main components: Dashboard, ActivityChart, PreferencePanel, NotificationList, and AlertBanner
- Uses a combination of global auth state and local component state
- Fetches data from 3 different API endpoints"
```

### Level 3: Component-Level Context

**Definition**: Detailed understanding of a specific component's purpose, props, state, and behavior.

**Key Elements**:
- Component purpose and responsibilities
- Props interface and validation
- Internal state management
- Event handlers and side effects
- Rendering logic and conditions
- Styling approach
- Performance considerations

**How to Establish**:
```
"The ActivityChart component:
- Renders user activity data in a bar chart
- Accepts props for data, timeframe, and appearance
- Uses the useActivityData hook for data transformation
- Has local state for chart interactions
- Uses memo and useCallback for performance optimization
- Follows our chart styling pattern with theme integration"
```

### Level 4: Implementation-Level Context

**Definition**: The most granular understanding related to specific implementation details.

**Key Elements**:
- Current file being edited
- Function or hook being implemented
- Specific logic being addressed
- Edge cases being handled
- Current bugs or issues

**How to Establish**:
```
"In the useActivityData hook, we need to optimize the data transformation function. 
Currently, it recalculates on every render even when data hasn't changed. 
We should implement memoization using useMemo with the appropriate dependency array."
```

## Context Maintenance Strategies

### 1. Project Context Documentation

Maintain a central source of project context in documentation:

- **Project README**: Overview, setup, architecture
- **Architecture.md**: Detailed architectural decisions
- **Conventions.md**: Coding standards and patterns
- **ComponentLibrary.md**: Documentation of shared components

### 2. Component Context in Code

Embed context in the code itself:

- Clear TypeScript interfaces for props
- JSDoc comments explaining component purpose
- Descriptive variable and function names
- Code organization that follows logical patterns

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Displays user activity in a customizable chart format
 * 
 * @example
 * <ActivityChart
 *   data={userData}
 *   timeframe="weekly"
 *   showLegend={true}
 * />
 */
interface ActivityChartProps {
  /** Array of activity data points */
  data: ActivityDataPoint[];
  /** Timeframe to display (daily, weekly, monthly) */
  timeframe: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
  /** Whether to show the chart legend */
  showLegend?: boolean;
  /** Callback when a data point is clicked */
  onDataPointClick?: (point: ActivityDataPoint) => void;
}
```

### 3. Context Refreshing with AI

Periodically refresh the AI's understanding:

- **Summary Statements**: "As a reminder, we're using the repository pattern for our API calls."
- **Context Updates**: "I've changed our styling approach to use CSS Modules instead of styled-components."
- **Boundary Setting**: "For this task, focus only on the notification components, not the entire dashboard."

### 4. Progressive Context Expansion

Build context progressively during development:

1. Start with high-level project context
2. Introduce relevant feature context
3. Focus on specific component context
4. Dive into implementation details
5. Return to broader context when changing focus

## Context Communication Patterns

### 1. Context-Setting Pattern

Use this pattern when starting work on a new area:

```
"I'm going to work on the ProductCatalog feature. This feature:
- Displays products in a grid or list view
- Allows filtering and sorting products
- Uses virtual scrolling for performance
- Connects to the product API via our useProducts hook
- Uses the existing Card component for product display"
```

### 2. Context-Refreshing Pattern

Use this pattern periodically during development:

```
"To recap what we've established:
1. We're using the compound component pattern for our Form components
2. Form state is managed with our useForm hook
3. Validation follows our schema validation pattern
4. We're prioritizing accessibility in all form controls"
```

### 3. Context-Switching Pattern

Use this pattern when changing focus:

```
"Now we're going to switch from the product list view to implement the product detail view.
The detail view:
- Is accessible at the /products/:id route
- Fetches detailed product data from the API
- Shows product information, images, pricing, and related items
- Allows adding the product to the cart
- Has a responsive layout that adapts to mobile devices"
```

### 4. Context-Question Pattern

Use this pattern to verify understanding:

```
"Before we proceed with implementing the shopping cart, let me confirm:
1. Are we using Zustand for cart state management?
2. Should cart state persist across page refreshes?
3. Are we following the existing pattern in CartItem components?
4. Are there any specific performance concerns I should address?"
```

## Context-Rich Component Development Example

### Initial Context-Setting

```
"I need to create a ProductFilterSidebar component that:
- Displays filter options for the product catalog
- Allows selection of multiple filter values
- Shows active filters with ability to remove them
- Collapses on mobile devices
- Updates the URL query parameters when filters change
- Follows our existing sidebar design pattern"
```

### Component Planning with Context

```
"Based on our component patterns, the ProductFilterSidebar should:
1. Use our existing Sidebar component as a container
2. Implement FilterGroup components for each filter category
3. Use FilterOption components for individual options
4. Use our useUrlState hook to sync with URL parameters
5. Follow responsive design patterns with our breakpoints
6. Include accessibility features like keyboard navigation"
```

### Implementation with Context References

```
"Let's implement the FilterGroup component following our existing pattern:
- It should be a controlled component receiving props for options and selection
- Use our Accordion component for expandable sections
- Follow our spacing system with 'sm' spacing between options
- Use our checkbox component for multi-select options
- Implement event handlers following our naming convention"
```

## Common Context Management Challenges

### Challenge 1: Context Overload

**Issue**: Providing too much irrelevant context that overwhelms.

**Solution**: Focus context on the current task, with just enough broader context to ensure alignment.

### Challenge 2: Context Staleness

**Issue**: Working with outdated understanding of the project.

**Solution**: Regularly refresh context, especially after significant changes.

### Challenge 3: Implicit Context

**Issue**: Assuming the AI understands context that hasn't been explicitly shared.

**Solution**: Be explicit about important contextual details, even if they seem obvious.

### Challenge 4: Context Fragmentation

**Issue**: Context spread across multiple conversations without coherence.

**Solution**: Periodically consolidate and summarize context.
