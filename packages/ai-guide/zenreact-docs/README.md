# ZenReact: Autonomous React Development

Welcome to ZenReact, a React application framework designed for optimal autonomous development with AI assistance. This documentation guides both developers and AI assistants on how to effectively collaborate on building React applications.

## Documentation Purpose

This guide helps establish clear patterns, workflows, and expectations for AI-assisted React development. By following these guidelines, developers can:

1. Maximize productivity with AI agents
2. Maintain consistent codebase architecture
3. Ensure best practices in React development
4. Create context-rich communication with AI assistants

## Core Documentation Sections

- [Architecture Rules](./rules/architecture-rules.md) - Project structure guidelines

## Getting Started

If you're new to autonomous development with ZenReact:

1. Read the [Development Workflow](./guides/01-development-workflow.md) document first
2. Familiarize yourself with the [Context Management](./guides/02-context-management.md) approach
3. Review the [Component Rules](./rules/component-rules.md) and [Component Template](./templates/component-template.md)
4. Explore [AI Collaboration Rules](./rules/ai-collaboration-rules.md) for effective AI assistance

## For AI Assistants

AI agents should:
1. Maintain awareness of the project's component hierarchy and architecture
2. Follow the established patterns in the templates directory
3. Adhere to the rules in the rules directory
4. Ask clarifying questions when context is insufficient
5. Suggest improvements that align with project standards

## Contributing

This documentation evolves with the project. Propose changes that improve clarity, address gaps, or incorporate new best practices as they emerge.
