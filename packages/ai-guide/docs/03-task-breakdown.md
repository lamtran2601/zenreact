# Task Breakdown for Autonomous AI Agents

## Overview

Effective task breakdown allows autonomous AI agents to transform complex development projects into manageable, executable units of work. This document outlines methodologies, patterns, and best practices for dividing large software development efforts into discrete tasks that can be implemented independently.

## Core Principles

### 1. Progressive Refinement

Tasks should be broken down with increasing specificity:

- **Epics**: Major functional areas (e.g., "Authentication System")
- **Features**: Specific capabilities (e.g., "Password Reset Flow")
- **User Stories**: User-centered capabilities (e.g., "As a user, I can request a password reset via email")
- **Tasks**: Technical implementation units (e.g., "Create password reset email template")
- **Subtasks**: Granular units of work (e.g., "Implement email template validation")

### 2. Dependency-Aware Sequencing

Task breakdown should account for dependencies:

- Identify critical path components
- Sequence tasks to minimize blocking dependencies
- Recognize shared dependencies across multiple tasks
- Group related tasks that can benefit from simultaneous implementation

### 3. Balanced Granularity

Tasks should be sized appropriately:

- Small enough to be clearly defined and estimated
- Large enough to represent meaningful progress
- Consistently sized for predictable implementation
- Encapsulated with clear boundaries

## Task Breakdown Methodologies

### Component-Based Breakdown

```
1. Identify major system components
2. For each component:
   a. Define required functionality
   b. Break into logical subcomponents
   c. Define interfaces between subcomponents
3. Convert each subcomponent into implementation tasks
4. Identify cross-component integration tasks
```

### User Journey Breakdown

```
1. Map complete user journeys through the system
2. Identify key interaction points in each journey
3. For each interaction:
   a. Define frontend requirements
   b. Define backend requirements
   c. Define data requirements
4. Create tasks addressing each requirement
5. Add cross-cutting tasks (error handling, validation, etc.)
```

### Feature Slicing

```
1. Define minimum viable implementation of a feature
2. Create tasks to implement the minimal version
3. Identify enhancements to the minimal version
4. Create separate tasks for each enhancement
5. Define dependencies between base implementation and enhancements
```

## Task Definition Patterns

### Implementation Task Pattern

```
Task: [Brief descriptive title]
Description: [Detailed explanation of what needs to be done]
Acceptance Criteria:
- [Specific, testable condition 1]
- [Specific, testable condition 2]
Dependencies:
- [Prerequisite task 1]
- [Prerequisite task 2]
Technical Constraints:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
Estimated Complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
```

### Research Task Pattern

```
Task: [Question or topic to research]
Objectives:
- [Specific information to discover 1]
- [Specific information to discover 2]
Acceptance Criteria:
- [Format of expected output]
- [Specific questions that must be answered]
Resources:
- [Potential information source 1]
- [Potential information source 2]
Output Destination: [Where findings should be documented]
```

### Integration Task Pattern

```
Task: [Integration objective]
Systems to Integrate:
- [System 1] with [System 2]
Interface Requirements:
- [Data to be exchanged]
- [Communication protocols]
- [Error handling expectations]
Verification Approach:
- [How integration will be tested]
Fallback Strategy:
- [What to do if integration fails]
```

## Best Practices

- **Independent Completion**: Tasks should be completable without waiting for others when possible
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each task should have well-defined start and end points
- **Visible Progress**: Tasks should produce tangible, demonstrable results
- **Testability**: Each task should include how its completion can be verified
- **Appropriate Detail**: Include enough detail to implement without ambiguity
- **Resource Consideration**: Consider time, knowledge, and tool requirements

## Task Sequencing Techniques

### Parallel Track Sequencing

Organize tasks into parallel tracks that can proceed independently:

```
Track A (UI):
- Task A1: Design user interface components
- Task A2: Implement basic UI structure
- Task A3: Add interactive elements
- Task A4: Style and polish UI

Track B (Backend):
- Task B1: Design data models
- Task B2: Implement API endpoints
- Task B3: Add business logic
- Task B4: Optimize performance

Track C (Testing):
- Task C1: Create test plan
- Task C2: Write unit tests
- Task C3: Create integration tests
- Task C4: Perform user acceptance testing
```

### Incremental Functionality Sequencing

Sequence tasks to build functionality incrementally:

```
Phase 1 (Core Functionality):
- Task 1.1: Create basic user authentication
- Task 1.2: Implement minimal data storage
- Task 1.3: Build simple user interface

Phase 2 (Enhanced Functionality):
- Task 2.1: Add role-based permissions
- Task 2.2: Implement advanced data retrieval
- Task 2.3: Enhance user interface

Phase 3 (Complete Features):
- Task 3.1: Add multi-factor authentication
- Task 3.2: Implement data analytics
- Task 3.3: Add advanced UI features
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Monolithic Tasks**: Tasks too large to complete in a reasonable timeframe
- **Ambiguous Boundaries**: Unclear where one task ends and another begins
- **Hidden Dependencies**: Undocumented requirements between tasks
- **Inconsistent Granularity**: Mix of very small and very large tasks
- **Incomplete Specifications**: Tasks missing critical details for implementation
- **Overlapping Responsibilities**: Multiple tasks addressing the same functionality

## Templates
