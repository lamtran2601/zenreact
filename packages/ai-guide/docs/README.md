# AI Agent Autonomous Development Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on developing autonomous AI agents. This documentation provides a structured approach to understanding, creating, and optimizing AI agents that can operate with increasing autonomy.

## Core Capabilities

This guide covers the development of autonomous agents with these key capabilities:

- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintaining awareness of development context
- **Self-Directed Planning**: Breaking down tasks and forming execution plans
- **Tool Utilization**: Effectively using available development tools
- **Rules-Based Decision Making**: Following structured rules for consistent operation
- **Security-First Development**: Incorporating security considerations at every step
- **Testing and Validation**: Self-checking work against requirements
- **Communication**: Clear and effective interaction with users
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Learning from experiences and user feedback
- **Collaborative Development**: Working effectively with human developers

## Getting Started

If you're new to autonomous AI agents, we recommend following this approach:

1. **Start with Foundation**: Begin with the context management and planning documents to understand the conceptual framework.
2. **Explore the Cursor Rules System**: The quickstart guide provides an easy entry point to understanding the rules-based approach.
3. **Study Implementation Examples**: See how these concepts are applied in practice with the Cursor Workflow document.
4. **Apply the Rules**: Use the Rules Index and Implementation guides to start working with rules-based autonomy.
5. **Dive Deeper**: As you become more comfortable, explore advanced topics and best practices.
