# Cursor Development Workflow for Autonomous AI Agents

## Overview

This document outlines a practical workflow for developing with Cursor as an autonomous AI agent. It applies the principles, patterns, and best practices described in the previous documents to create an effective development process that leverages Cursor's AI capabilities for maximum productivity and code quality.

## Understanding Cursor as an AI Agent

Cursor operates as an AI-enhanced IDE with agent-like properties:

- It has access to the codebase and can explore it
- It can understand and generate code in multiple languages
- It maintains context through conversation
- It can execute terminal commands when directed
- It can read, edit, and create files
- It has tools for semantic code search and analysis
- It can evaluate and refine its own suggestions

## Setting Up for Autonomous Development

### Environment Preparation

```
1. Organize your project with clear structure and documentation
2. Ensure critical files (README, architecture docs) are informative
3. Set up proper .gitignore and editor configurations
4. Install necessary development tools and dependencies
5. Configure version control system
6. Establish style guides and linting configurations
7. Set up automated testing infrastructure
```

### Agent Capability Configuration

```
1. Familiarize Cursor with your specific project through initial exploration
2. Establish clear communication patterns with the agent
3. Define scope boundaries for agent operation
4. Configure tool access permissions appropriately
5. Set up working directories and environment variables
6. Create project-specific templates and snippets
7. Document project-specific conventions and requirements
```

## Core Development Workflow

### Planning Phase

```
1. Describe the feature or task to Cursor in natural language
2. Ask Cursor to analyze requirements and identify ambiguities
3. Request that Cursor propose an implementation approach
4. Review and refine the proposed approach
5. Have Cursor break down the task into implementable steps
6. Define acceptance criteria for the task
7. Establish a development sequence
```

### Implementation Phase

```
1. For each subtask:
   a. Request Cursor to search for relevant code
   b. Ask Cursor to propose specific changes
   c. Review suggestions before applying
   d. Have Cursor explain complex logic when needed
   e. Refine the implementation through iterative feedback
2. As development progresses:
   a. Regularly verify that changes meet requirements
   b. Use Cursor to identify potential issues
   c. Request refactoring suggestions for code improvements
```

### Testing Phase

```
1. Ask Cursor to propose test cases based on requirements
2. Request test implementation for key functionality
3. Have Cursor review existing tests for comprehensiveness
4. Use Cursor to identify edge cases requiring testing
5. Fix issues identified during testing
6. Verify test coverage with Cursor's assistance
```

### Review Phase

```
1. Request a summary of all changes made
2. Ask Cursor to self-review the implementation
3. Have Cursor check for common issues:
   a. Performance concerns
   b. Security vulnerabilities
   c. Error handling completeness
   d. Style consistency
4. Address any issues identified in the review
5. Prepare documentation updates with Cursor's help
```

## Effective Prompting for Cursor

### General Prompting Guidelines

- Be specific about what you need
- Provide necessary context
- Specify the desired format for responses
- Indicate level of detail required
- Reference existing code patterns to follow
- Clarify any constraints or requirements
- Break complex requests into manageable pieces

### Task-Specific Prompt Templates

#### Code Exploration Prompt

```
Please help me understand the [component/feature] in this codebase:
1. Find the main files related to [component/feature]
2. Explain how they work together
3. Identify the key functions/classes involved
4. Describe the data flow
5. Note any potential issues or areas of complexity
```

#### Implementation Planning Prompt

```
I need to implement [feature description]. Please help me:
1. Analyze what files need to be modified or created
2. Break this task down into specific implementation steps
3. Identify potential challenges or edge cases
4. Suggest an approach that follows our existing patterns
5. Provide a high-level implementation plan
```

#### Code Generation Prompt

```
Please help me implement the following:

Feature: [feature description]
Files to modify: [file paths]
Specific requirements:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]

Please follow these guidelines:
- Match our existing code style
- Include error handling
- Add appropriate comments
- Consider edge cases
```

#### Code Review Prompt

```
Please review the following code:
[code or file reference]

Focus on:
1. Functionality (does it meet requirements)
2. Performance considerations
3. Error handling
4. Security issues
5. Readability and maintainability
6. Alignment with best practices
```

## Collaborative Development Patterns

### Progressive Refinement Pattern

```
1. Start with a high-level description of what you need
2. Have Cursor propose an initial approach
3. Provide feedback on the approach
4. Request more detailed implementation
5. Review and ask for specific adjustments
6. Iterate until the implementation meets requirements
```

### Context Building Pattern

```
1. Introduce Cursor to the project area you're working on
2. Have Cursor explore the relevant code
3. Confirm Cursor's understanding of the code
4. Clarify any misunderstandings
5. Only then proceed to implementation requests
```

### Human-Agent Pair Programming

```
1. Clearly define roles:
   - Human: Domain expertise, requirements, final decisions
   - Cursor: Code generation, pattern recognition, suggestions
2. Maintain continuous dialogue during development
3. Human reviews and approves all significant changes
4. Cursor proposes alternatives and improvements
5. Both contribute to problem-solving
```

## Best Practices for Cursor-Assisted Development

- **Start with Exploration**: Have Cursor explore and understand code before making changes
- **Verify Understanding**: Confirm Cursor correctly understands requirements before implementation
- **Incremental Changes**: Prefer smaller, focused changes over large restructuring
- **Regular Verification**: Continuously test and verify changes
- **Explicit Constraints**: Clearly communicate limitations and requirements
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Use Cursor to document decisions and reasoning
- **Selective Automation**: Use Cursor for appropriate tasks, maintain human oversight
- **Clear Communication**: Phrase requests clearly and unambiguously
- **Contextual Awareness**: Help Cursor maintain awareness of the broader system
- **Quality Standards**: Hold Cursor-generated code to the same standards as human code

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Vague Requests**: Making unclear or ambiguous requests
- **Context Overload**: Providing too much information at once
- **Black Box Acceptance**: Accepting Cursor suggestions without review
- **Excessive Rework**: Repeatedly changing requirements mid-implementation
- **Minimal Context**: Not providing sufficient project context
- **Mismatched Expectations**: Expecting capabilities beyond what Cursor can provide
- **Fragmentary Development**: Losing continuity across development sessions
- **Complete Delegation**: Relying entirely on Cursor without direction
- **Ignoring Agent Limitations**: Not accounting for Cursor's knowledge boundaries
