# Planning and Analysis for Autonomous AI Agents

## Overview

Effective planning and analysis enable autonomous AI agents to approach complex software development problems systematically. This document outlines techniques for understanding requirements, designing solutions, and creating actionable development plans without human guidance.

## Planning Principles

### 1. Multi-horizon Planning

Autonomous agents should plan at multiple time horizons:

- **Strategic planning**: Overall architecture and approach (weeks/months)
- **Tactical planning**: Feature implementation strategy (days)
- **Operational planning**: Specific coding tasks (hours)

### 2. Constraint-Based Analysis

Agents should explicitly identify and work within various constraints:

- Technical constraints (language limitations, platform requirements)
- Resource constraints (time, memory, performance targets)
- Quality constraints (security requirements, compliance standards)
- Integration constraints (API contracts, external dependencies)

### 3. Risk-Aware Planning

Proactively identify and mitigate potential problems:

- Identify high-risk areas early
- Develop contingency plans for critical components
- Prioritize implementation of uncertain elements for early validation
- Plan for iterative refinement in areas of high uncertainty

## Analysis Patterns

### Requirements Disambiguation Pattern

```
1. Identify vague or ambiguous requirements
2. Generate clarifying questions
3. Propose reasonable interpretations for each ambiguity
4. Document assumptions made
5. Plan validation steps for critical assumptions
```

### Solution Space Exploration Pattern

```
1. Generate multiple alternative approaches
2. Analyze trade-offs for each approach:
   - Performance implications
   - Complexity and maintainability
   - Integration difficulty
   - Scalability characteristics
3. Recommend approach with rationale
4. Document alternatives considered
```

### Dependency Analysis Pattern

```
1. Identify external dependencies
2. Determine versioning strategy
3. Assess risk of each dependency:
   - Maintenance status
   - Community support
   - Security history
   - License constraints
4. Plan for dependency isolation where appropriate
```

## Planning Methodologies

### Recursive Problem Decomposition

```
1. Break large problems into conceptual components
2. For each component:
   a. Define interfaces and contracts
   b. Identify internal complexity
   c. Further decompose if complexity exceeds threshold
3. Define integration strategy between components
4. Establish order of implementation
```

### Incremental Value Planning

```
1. Identify minimum viable solution
2. Plan incremental enhancements
3. Ensure each increment:
   a. Is independently testable
   b. Delivers tangible value
   c. Maintains system stability
4. Prioritize increments by value/effort ratio
```

## Best Practices

- **Explicit Assumptions**: Clearly document all assumptions made during planning
- **Testability Planning**: Design with verification in mind from the beginning
- **Decision Journaling**: Record key decisions and their rationales
- **Complexity Management**: Identify and simplify unnecessarily complex elements
- **Interface-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementations
- **Progressive Elaboration**: Start with high-level plans and refine as execution proceeds

## Templates

### Solution Design Template

```
Problem Statement:
[Clear statement of the problem to be solved]

Proposed Approach:
[High-level description of the solution approach]

Architecture:
[Diagram or description of component architecture]

Key Components:
- [Component 1]:
  - Purpose: [Description]
  - Interfaces: [APIs/Contracts]
  - Internal Structure: [Design details]

- [Component 2]:
  - Purpose: [Description]
  - Interfaces: [APIs/Contracts]
  - Internal Structure: [Design details]

Integration Strategy:
[How components will work together]

Implementation Plan:
1. [Phase 1 with specific objectives]
2. [Phase 2 with specific objectives]
3. [Phase 3 with specific objectives]

Validation Approach:
[Strategy for testing and validating the solution]

Alternatives Considered:
- [Alternative 1]: [Reason for rejection]
- [Alternative 2]: [Reason for rejection]
```

### Risk Assessment Template

```
Risk: [Description of potential issue]
Impact: [High/Medium/Low] - [Description of consequences]
Probability: [High/Medium/Low]
Mitigation Strategy: [Approach to reduce likelihood or impact]
Contingency Plan: [Actions if risk materializes]
Trigger: [Indicator that risk is becoming reality]
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-analyzing to the point of delayed execution
- **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before understanding actual requirements
- **Planning Monoliths**: Creating plans too rigid to adapt to changing conditions
- **Underestimated Complexity**: Failing to recognize hidden complexity
- **Design Contradiction**: Creating mutually incompatible requirements
- **Perfectionism**: Striving for ideal solutions when "good enough" would suffice

## Evaluation Techniques

- **Scenario Testing**: Mentally execute the plan against various scenarios
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Validate technical approach against constraints
- **Performance Modeling**: Estimate performance characteristics
- **Security Analysis**: Evaluate approach for security vulnerabilities
- **Maintainability Review**: Assess long-term maintainability of design
