# Glossary

This document defines key terms and concepts used throughout the React AI Assistant Tooling system to ensure consistent understanding and communication.

## Core Concepts

### AI Assistant
A software tool powered by artificial intelligence that helps with code generation, refactoring, explanation, and other development tasks. In our context, this primarily refers to AI coding assistants like Cursor AI.

### Pattern
A reusable solution to a common problem in React development, documented in a standardized format that includes implementation examples, use cases, and best practices.

### Rule
A specific guideline or standard for code quality, organization, or implementation that should be followed to maintain consistency and best practices.

### Prompt
A carefully crafted instruction or query provided to an AI assistant to generate specific code, explanations, or other outputs related to React development.

### Template
A pre-defined, reusable code structure that serves as a starting point for implementing components, hooks, or other features.

## Pattern Types

### Component Pattern
A documented approach for implementing React UI components with consistent structure, props, and behavior.

### Hook Pattern
A documented approach for implementing React custom hooks with consistent inputs, outputs, and behavior.

### State Pattern
A documented approach for managing state in React applications using specific state management techniques.

### Architecture Pattern
A documented approach for organizing React code, files, and folders in a consistent and maintainable way.

## Development Concepts

### Functional Component
A React component implemented as a JavaScript/TypeScript function that returns JSX, as opposed to a class component.

### Custom Hook
A JavaScript/TypeScript function that uses React hooks and follows the naming convention of starting with "use", allowing for reuse of stateful logic across components.

### Controlled Component
A form element whose value is controlled by React state, with changes handled through event handlers.

### Uncontrolled Component
A form element that maintains its own internal state, with React accessing values using refs.

### Higher-Order Component (HOC)
A function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior.

### Render Prop
A technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function that returns a React element.

### Context
React's mechanism for passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### Reducer
A pure function that takes the previous state and an action, then returns the next state, commonly used with useReducer or Redux.

## TypeScript Concepts

### Interface
A TypeScript structure that defines the shape of an object, commonly used for component props and state.

### Type
A TypeScript definition that can represent primitives, unions, intersections, and more complex types.

### Generic
A TypeScript feature that allows creating reusable components or functions that work with different types while maintaining type safety.

### Type Guard
A function or expression that performs a runtime check to ensure a value is of a specific type.

### Discriminated Union
A TypeScript pattern using a shared field (the discriminant) to differentiate between different object types in a union.

## Quality Concepts

### Accessibility (a11y)
The practice of making web applications usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

### ARIA Attributes
Accessibility attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) that communicate the purpose and current state of UI elements to assistive technologies.

### Memoization
An optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

### Code Splitting
The practice of splitting code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, improving initial load performance.

### Lazy Loading
A technique to delay loading parts of an application until they are actually needed.

### Virtual DOM
React's lightweight representation of the actual DOM, which it uses to determine the most efficient way to update the browser DOM.

### Side Effect
Any change to state or behavior that occurs outside the component's rendered output, often managed with useEffect or similar hooks.

## AI Workflow Concepts

### Prompt Engineering
The practice of designing and refining prompts to achieve specific, high-quality outputs from AI assistants.

### Fine-tuning
The process of adapting a pre-trained AI model to specific tasks or domains by training it on additional targeted data.

### Completion
The output generated by an AI model in response to a prompt.

### Zero-shot Learning
The capability of an AI to perform tasks it wasn't explicitly trained on, based on instructions in the prompt.

### Few-shot Learning
Providing a few examples within a prompt to guide the AI in generating similar outputs.

### Iterative Development
A workflow where code is developed progressively through multiple rounds of AI-assisted generation and refinement.

## React-Specific Terminology

### JSX
JavaScript XML, a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML and allows for describing React elements in a familiar way.

### Props
Properties passed to React components that allow customizing their behavior and appearance.

### State
Data that changes over time in a React component, typically managed with useState or useReducer hooks.

### Effect
Side effects in React components, typically managed with the useEffect hook.

### Ref
A way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method, or to persist values across renders without causing re-renders.

### Fragment
A React component that allows grouping multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.

### Key
A special attribute used by React to identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed in a list.

### Lifecycle
The series of phases a React component goes through, from mounting to unmounting. In modern React, these are primarily managed through hooks like useEffect.

## Tooling Concepts

### Linter
A tool that analyzes code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

### ESLint
A popular JavaScript linting tool used to enforce code quality and style rules.

### TypeScript Compiler
The tool that checks TypeScript code for type errors and compiles it to JavaScript.

### Test Runner
A tool that executes tests and reports results, such as Jest or Vitest.

### React Testing Library
A library for testing React components that encourages testing components as users would interact with them.

### Storybook
A development environment for UI components, allowing for isolated development and documentation.

### bundler
A tool that processes JavaScript code and its dependencies into optimized bundles for production, such as webpack, Rollup, or esbuild.

## Project Organization Concepts

### Monorepo
A version control repository containing multiple related projects with well-defined relationships.

### Workspace
A logical grouping of related code and resources, often used in monorepos to organize different packages or applications.

### Package
A discrete unit of software with its own dependencies and functionality, typically managed with npm or Yarn.

### Feature-Based Organization
A project structure approach where code is organized by feature rather than by file type.

### Atomic Design
A methodology for creating design systems with five distinct levels: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
