# Getting Started with React AI Assistant Tooling

This guide will help you quickly integrate React AI Assistant Tooling into your development workflow. We'll cover basic setup, initial usage, and how to gradually adopt the system's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 16.x or later
- A React project (any version)
- Git (for version control)
- Optional but recommended: Cursor AI or another AI coding assistant

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/your-org/react-ai-assistant-tooling.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd react-ai-assistant-tooling
```

### 2. Explore the Structure

Take a moment to explore the project structure:

```

## Quick Start Path

### Day 1: Basic Exploration

1. **Read the Introduction**
   - Review [Introduction](../overview/INTRODUCTION.md) to understand the system philosophy
   - Explore the [Architecture](../overview/ARCHITECTURE.md) to learn about the system structure

2. **Explore Pattern Library**
   - Browse the [Component Patterns](../../patterns/components/) to see available UI patterns
   - Look through [Hook Patterns](../../patterns/hooks/) for reusable logic patterns

3. **Review Core Rules**
   - Check [Code Rules](../../rules/code/STRUCTURE.md) for basic code organization principles
   - Review [TypeScript Rules](../../rules/typescript/TYPES.md) if using TypeScript

### Day 2-3: First Implementation

1. **Choose a Pattern to Implement**
   - Select a simple pattern from the pattern library
   - Read the pattern documentation carefully
   - Identify how it can be applied to your project

2. **Use Prompts with AI**
   - Find relevant prompts in the [Generation Prompts](../../prompts/generation/) directory
   - Customize a prompt for your specific needs
   - Use the prompt with Cursor or another AI assistant

3. **Apply Templates**
   - Find appropriate templates in the [Templates](../../templates/) directory
   - Customize the template for your specific use case
   - Integrate the template into your project

### Week 1: Expanding Usage

1. **Adopt Core Rules**
   - Review and adopt naming conventions from [Naming Rules](../../rules/code/NAMING.md)
   - Apply structure guidelines from [Structure Rules](../../rules/code/STRUCTURE.md)

2. **Explore More Patterns**
   - Implement state management patterns from [State Patterns](../../patterns/state/)
   - Try architecture patterns from [Architecture Patterns](../../patterns/architecture/)

3. **Use Simple Scripts**
   - Try the component generator: `node scripts/generation/create-component.js`
   - Run validation tools: `node scripts/validation/pattern-check.js`

### Week 2-3: Integration and Adaptation

1. **Integrate with Your Workflow**
   - Set up editor integrations from the [Tools](../../tools/) directory
   - Configure recommended extensions and settings

2. **Customize for Your Team**
   - Adapt rules to match your team's preferences
   - Create custom patterns for your specific needs
   - Modify prompts to better suit your project

3. **Share with Team Members**
   - Introduce the system to your team
   - Gather feedback on the patterns and rules
   - Iterate based on team input

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New Component

Let's create a new component using the system:

1. **Consult Component Patterns**
   - Browse [Component Patterns](../../patterns/components/) to find an appropriate pattern
   - Let's say you choose the "Data Display Card" pattern

2. **Use a Generation Prompt**
   - Find the component generation prompt in [Component Prompts](../../prompts/generation/COMPONENT.md)
   - Customize it for your specific needs:

```
I need to create a React component for a "ProductCard" following the Data Display Card pattern.
The component should:
- Display product image, name, price, and a short description
- Have a "Add to Cart" button
- Show a badge for sale items
- Use TypeScript for type definitions
- Follow the project's naming and structure conventions

Please provide the implementation with appropriate types, styles, and tests.
```

3. **Apply Generated Code**
   - Use the code generated by your AI assistant
   - Customize it further as needed
   - Place it in your project following structure guidelines

4. **Validate the Implementation**
   - Run validation scripts to ensure adherence to rules:
   - `node scripts/validation/pattern-check.js src/components/ProductCard.tsx`

### Example 2: Refactoring Existing Code

Let's refactor an existing component:

1. **Identify Issues**
   - Review your component against [Code Rules](../../rules/code/)
   - Note areas for improvement

2. **Use Refactoring Prompts**
   - Find appropriate prompts in [Refactoring Prompts](../../prompts/refactoring/)
   - Customize a prompt for your specific needs:

```
I have a React component that needs refactoring to improve performance.
The component is re-rendering too often due to unnecessary state updates.
Please help optimize it using memoization and proper dependency arrays.

Here's the current implementation:

[paste your component code here]
```

3. **Apply Refactored Code**
   - Review the suggested changes from your AI assistant
   - Apply the optimized implementation
   - Test the component to ensure it maintains functionality

### Example 3: Creating a Custom Hook

Let's create a custom hook:

1. **Consult Hook Patterns**
   - Browse [Hook Patterns](../../patterns/hooks/) to find relevant patterns
   - Choose an appropriate pattern for your needs

2. **Use Hook Template**
   - Find the hook template in [Hook Templates](../../templates/hooks/)
   - Customize it for your specific use case

3. **Implement and Test**
   - Create the hook implementation
   - Write tests to ensure it works correctly
   - Document the hook following the project's standards

## Common Questions

### How do I decide which pattern to use?

Start by identifying your specific need (UI component, state management, etc.). Then browse the relevant pattern category and look for patterns that solve similar problems. Read the descriptions and examples to find the best match.

### Can I modify patterns to fit my needs?

Absolutely! Patterns are guidelines, not rigid rules. Feel free to adapt them to your specific requirements while maintaining the core principles.

### How do I contribute new patterns?

Follow the guide in [Pattern Development](../technical/PATTERN_DEVELOPMENT.md) to create new patterns. Submit them to your team's repository or contribute them back to the main project.

### How do I use AI assistants effectively with this system?

Review [Cursor Integration](./CURSOR_INTEGRATION.md) for specific guidance on using Cursor AI. The key is to provide clear prompts that reference specific patterns and rules from the system.

## Next Steps

After getting comfortable with the basics:

1. Explore the [Workflow Guide](./WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for integrating the system into your daily workflow
2. Learn about [Cursor Integration](./CURSOR_INTEGRATION.md) for optimizing AI assistant usage
3. Check out [CLI Usage](./CLI_USAGE.md) for command-line productivity tools
4. Review [Technical Documentation](../technical/) for extending and customizing the system

## Support and Feedback
